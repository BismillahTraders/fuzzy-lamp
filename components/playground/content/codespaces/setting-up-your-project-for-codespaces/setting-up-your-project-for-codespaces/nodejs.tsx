  intro: dedent`
  This guide shows you how to add a [dev container](/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project) to define the Codespaces configuration for your **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, or **TypeScript** project. For other project languages, click the language button to the right.

  prerequisites: dedent`
    - You should have an existing JavaScript, Node.js, or TypeScript project in a repository on GitHub.com. If you don't have a project, you can try this tutorial with the following example: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node
    - Codespaces must be enabled for your organization. For more information, see "[Enabling Codespaces for your organization](/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-codespaces-for-your-organization)."

      title: 'Step 1: Open your project in a codespace',
      content: dedent`
        1. Under the repository name, use the **Code** drop-down menu, and in the **Codespaces** tab, click **New codespace**.

            ![New codespace button](/assets/images/help/codespaces/new-codespace-button.png)

           If you don’t see this option, Codespaces isn't available for your project. See [Access to Codespaces](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#access-to-codespaces) for more information.

        When you create a codespace, your project is created on a remote VM that is dedicated to you. By default, the container for your codespace has many languages and runtimes including Node.js, JavaScript, Typescript, nvm, npm, and yarn. It also includes a common set of tools like git, wget, rsync, openssh, and nano.

        You can customize your codespace by adjusting the amount of vCPUs and RAM, [adding dotfiles to personalize your environment](/codespaces/setting-up-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account), or by modifying the tools and scripts installed.

        Codespaces uses a file called \`devcontainer.json\` to store configurations. On launch, Codespaces uses the file to install any tools, dependencies, or other set up that might be needed for the project. For more information, see "[Introduction to dev containers](/codespaces/setting-up-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project)."

      title: 'Step 2: Add a dev container to your codespace from a template',
      content: dedent`
        The default codespaces container will support running Node.js projects like [vscode-remote-try-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node) out of the box. By setting up a custom container you can customize the tools and scripts that run as part of codespace creation and ensure a fully reproducible environment for all Codespaces users in your repository.

        To set up your project with a custom container, you will need to use a \`devcontainer.json\` file to define the environment. In Codespaces you can add this either from a template or you can create your own. For more information on dev containers, see "[Introduction to dev containers](/codespaces/setting-up-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project)".

        1. Access the Command Palette (\`Shift + Command + P\` / \`Ctrl + Shift + P\`), then start typing "dev container". Select **Codespaces: Add Development Container Configuration Files...**.
          !["Codespaces: Add Development Container Configuration Files..." in the command palette](/assets/images/help/codespaces/add-prebuilt-container-command.png)
        2. For this example, click **Node.js**.  If you need additional features you can select any container that’s specific to Node or a combination of tools such as Node and MongoDB.
          ![Select Node option from the list](/assets/images/help/codespaces/add-node-prebuilt-container.png)
        3. Click the recommended version of Node.js.
          ![Node.js version selection](/assets/images/help/codespaces/add-node-version.png)
        4. Select any additional features to install and click **OK**.
        5. Access the command palette (\`Shift + Command + P\`/ \`Ctrl + Shift + P\`), then start typing "rebuild". Select **Codespaces: Rebuild Container**.

        Adding the Node.js dev container template adds a \`.devcontainer\` folder to the root of your project's repository with the following files:

        - \`devcontainer.json\`
        - Dockerfile

        The newly added \`devcontainer.json\` file defines a few properties that are described below.

      content: dedent`
        With your dev container added and a basic understanding of what everything does, you can now make changes to configure it for your environment. In this example, you'll add properties to install npm when your codespace launches and make a list of ports inside the container available locally.

        1. In the Explorer, select the \`devcontainer.json\` file from the tree to open it. You might have to expand the \`.devcontainer\` folder to see it.
          ![devcontainer.json file in the Explorer](/assets/images/help/codespaces/devcontainers-options.png)
        2. Add the following lines to your \`devcontainer.json\` file after \`extensions\`:

            \`\`\`js{:copy}
            "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
            "forwardPorts": [4000],
            \`\`\`
            For more information on \`devcontainer.json\` properties, see the [devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) in the Visual Studio Code docs.

        1. Access the command palette (\`Shift + Command + P\`/ \`Ctrl + Shift + P\`), then start typing "rebuild". Select **Codespaces: Rebuild Container**. 
            ![Rebuild container option](/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-rebuild.png)

              Rebuilding inside your codespace ensures your changes work as expected before you commit the changes to the repository. If something does result in a failure, you’ll be placed in a codespace with a recovery container that you can rebuild from to keep adjusting your container.

      content: dedent`
        In the previous section, you used the \`postCreateCommand\` to installing a set of packages via npm. You can now use this to run our application with npm.

        1. Run your start command in the terminal with \`npm start\`.

            ![npm start in terminal](/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-npmstart.png)

        2. When your project starts, you should see a message in the bottom right corner with a prompt to connect to the port your project uses.

      title: 'Step 5: Commit your changes',
      content: dedent`
      Once you've made changes to your codespace, either new code or configuration changes, you'll want to commit your changes. Committing changes to your repository ensures that anyone else who creates a codespace from this repository has the same configuration. This also means that any customization you do, such as adding Visual Studio Code extensions, will appear for all users.
