  intro: dedent`
    This guide shows you how to build, test, and publish a Python package.

    GitHub-hosted runners have a tools cache with pre-installed software, which includes Python and PyPy. You don't have to install anything! For a full list of up-to-date software and the pre-installed versions of Python and PyPy, see "[Specifications for GitHub-hosted runners](/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners/#supported-software)".
  `,
  prerequisites: dedent`
    You should be familiar with YAML and the syntax for GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[Learn GitHub-Actions](/actions/learn-github-actions)."

    We recommend that you have a basic understanding of Python, PyPy, and pip. For more information, see:
    - [Getting started with Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
    - [PyPy](https://pypy.org/)

      title: 'Using the Python starter workflow',
      content: dedent`
        GitHub provides a Python starter workflow that should work for most Python projects. This guide includes examples that you can use to customize the starter workflow. For more information, see the [Python starter workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/python-package.yml).

        To get started quickly, add the starter workflow to the \`.github/workflows\` directory of your repository.

      title: 'Specifying a Python version',
      content: dedent`
        To use a pre-installed version of Python or PyPy on a GitHub-hosted runner, use the \`setup-python\` action. This action finds a specific version of Python or PyPy from the tools cache on each runner and adds the necessary binaries to \`PATH\`, which persists for the rest of the job. If a specific version of Python is not pre-installed in the tools cache, the \`setup-python\` action will download and set up the appropriate version from the [\`python-versions\`](https://github.com/actions/python-versions) repository.

        Using the \`setup-python\` action is the recommended way of using Python with GitHub Actions because it ensures consistent behavior across different runners and different versions of Python. If you are using a self-hosted runner, you must install Python and add it to \`PATH\`. For more information, see the [\`setup-python\` action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python).
        
        The table below describes the locations for the tools cache in each GitHub-hosted runner.
        
        || Ubuntu | Mac | Windows |
        |------|-------|------|----------|
        |**Tool Cache Directory** |\`/opt/hostedtoolcache/*\`|\`/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache/*\`|\`C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\*\`|
        |**Python Tool Cache**|\`/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/*\`|\`/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache/Python/*\`|\`C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\*\`|
        |**PyPy Tool Cache**|\`/opt/hostedtoolcache/PyPy/*\`|\`/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache/PyPy/*\`|\`C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\PyPy\*\`|
        
        If you are using a self-hosted runner, you can configure the runner to use the \`setup-python\` action to manage your dependencies. For more information, see [using setup-python with a self-hosted runner](https://github.com/actions/setup-python#using-setup-python-with-a-self-hosted-runner) in the \`setup-python\` README.
        
        GitHub supports semantic versioning syntax. For more information, see "[Using semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning#using-semantic-versioning-to-specify-update-types-your-package-can-accept)" and the "[Semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/)."

        This example uses a matrix to run the job on multiple Python versions: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. For more information about matrix strategies and contexts, see "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)" and "[Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)."

        You can configure a specific version of python. For example, 3.8. Alternatively, you can use semantic version syntax to get the latest minor release. This example uses the latest minor release of Python 3.

      content: dedent`
        If you specify a version of Python that is not available, \`setup-python\` fails with an error such as: \`##[error]Version 3.4 with arch x64 not found\`. The error message includes the available versions.

        You can also use the \`exclude\` keyword in your workflow if there is a configuration of Python that you do not wish to run. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy)."

      title: 'Using the default Python version',
      content: dedent`
        We recommend using \`setup-python\` to configure the version of Python used in your workflows because it helps make your dependencies explicit. If you don't use \`setup-python\`, the default version of Python set in \`PATH\` is used in any shell when you call \`python\`. The default version of Python varies between GitHub-hosted runners, which may cause unexpected changes or use an older version than expected.

        | GitHub-hosted runner | Description |
        |----|----|
        | Ubuntu | Ubuntu runners have multiple versions of system Python installed under \`/usr/bin/python\` and \`/usr/bin/python3\`. The Python versions that come packaged with Ubuntu are in addition to the versions that GitHub installs in the tools cache. |
        | Windows | Excluding the versions of Python that are in the tools cache, Windows does not ship with an equivalent version of system Python. To maintain consistent behavior with other runners and to allow Python to be used out-of-the-box without the \`setup-python\` action, GitHub adds a few versions from the tools cache to \`PATH\`.|
        | macOS | The macOS runners have more than one version of system Python installed, in addition to the versions that are part of the tools cache. The system Python versions are located in the \`/usr/local/Cellar/python/*\` directory. |

      title: 'Installing dependencies',
      content: dedent`
        GitHub-hosted runners have the pip package manager installed. You can use pip to install dependencies from the PyPI package registry before building and testing your code. This example installs or upgrades the \`pip\` package installer and the \`setuptools\` and \`wheel\` packages.

        When using GitHub-hosted runners, you can also cache dependencies to speed up your workflow. For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/actions/guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)."

      title: 'Caching Dependencies',
      content: dedent`

        When using GitHub-hosted runners, you can cache and restore the dependencies using the [\`setup-python\` action](https://github.com/actions/setup-python). By default, the \`setup-python\` action searches for the dependency file (\`requirements.txt\` for pip or \`Pipfile.lock\` for pipenv) in the whole repository.

        If you have a custom requirement or need finer controls for caching, you can use the [\`cache\` action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache). Pip caches dependencies in different locations, depending on the operating system of the runner. The path you'll need to cache may differ from the Ubuntu example shown here, depending on the operating system you use. For more information, see [Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/actions/guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) and the [\`cache\` action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).

        With GitHub Actions, you can run tests with tox and spread the work across multiple jobs. You'll need to invoke tox using the \`-e py\` option to choose the version of Python in your \`PATH\`, rather than specifying a specific version. For more information, see [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For more information, see "[Persisting workflow data using artifacts](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts)."

        This example demonstrates how you can use the \`upload-artifact\` action to archive test results from running \`pytest\`. For more information, see the [\`upload-artifact\` action](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).

      title: 'Publishing to package registries',
      content: dedent`
        You can configure your workflow to publish your Python package to a package registry once your CI tests pass. This example demonstrates how you can use GitHub Actions to upload your package to PyPI each time you [publish a release](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository). 

        For this example, you will need to create two [PyPI API tokens](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken). You can use secrets to store the access tokens or credentials needed to publish your package. For more information, see "[Creating and using encrypted secrets](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets)."

        For more information about the starter workflow, see [\`python-publish\`](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/python-publish.yml).
