Companies can use an invoice method to participate in the {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} program. This can be particularly convenient if your company has an existing invoiced billing relationship with {% data variables.product.company_short %}. Companies paying by invoice get access to a {% data variables.product.product_name %} dashboard that measures open source contributions and activity across the public projects on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} they're interested in.

You can join this beta program by talking to your sales representative, or by [contacting us](https://support.github.com/contact/org-sponsors-waitlist).

For information about receiving payments from the Sponsors for Companies service, see "[Receiving payments from Sponsors for Companies](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/sponsors-for-companies)."
