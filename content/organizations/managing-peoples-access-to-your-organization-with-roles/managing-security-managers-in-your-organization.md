## Permissions for the security manager role

Members of a team with the security manager role have only the permissions required to effectively manage security for the organization.

- Read access on all repositories in the organization, in addition to any existing repository access
- Write access on all security alerts in the organization
- Access to the organization's security overview
- The ability to configure security settings at the organization level, including the ability to enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}
- The ability to configure security settings at the repository level, including the ability to enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}

If a team has the security manager role, people with admin access to the team and a specific repository can change the team's level of access to that repository but cannot remove the access. For more information, see "[Managing team access to an organization repository](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository){% ifversion ghes %}."{% else %} and "[Managing teams and people with access to your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)."{% endif %}

## Removing the security manager role from a team in your organization

{% warning %}

**Warning:** Removing the security manager role from a team will remove the team's ability to manage security alerts and settings across the organization, but the team will retain read access to repositories that was granted when the role was assigned. You must remove any unwanted read access manually. For more information, see "[Managing team access to an organization repository](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository#removing-a-teams-access-to-a-repository)."
