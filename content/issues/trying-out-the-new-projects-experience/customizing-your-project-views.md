## Project command palette

Use the project command palette to quickly change settings and run commands in your project.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing any part of a command or navigate through the command palette window to find a command. See the next sections for more examples of commands.

## Changing the project layout

You can view your project as a table or as a board.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Switch layout".
3. Choose the required command. For example, **Switch layout: Table**.
3. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to a view name and click **Table** or **Board**.

## Showing and hiding fields

You can show or hide a specific field.

In table layout:

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing the action you want to take ("show" or "hide") or the name of the field.
3. Choose the required command. For example, **Show: Milestone**.
4. Alternatively, click {% octicon "plus" aria-label="the plus icon" %} to the right of the table. In the drop-down menu that appears, indicate which fields to show or hide. A {% octicon "check" aria-label="check icon" %} indicates which fields are displayed.
5. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to the field name and click **Hide field**.

In board layout:

1. Click the drop-down menu next to the view name.
2. Under **configuration**, click {% octicon "list-unordered" aria-label="the unordered list icon" %}.
3. In the menu that's displayed, select fields to add them and deselect fields to remove them from the view.

## Reordering fields

You can change the order of fields.

1. Click the field header.
2. While clicking, drag the field to the required location.

## Reordering rows

In table layout, you can change the order of rows.

1. Click the number at the start of the row.
2. While clicking, drag the row to the required location.

## Sorting by field values

In table layout, you can sort items by a field value.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Sort by" or the name of the field you want to sort by.
3. Choose the required command. For example, **Sort by: Assignees, asc**.
4. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to the field name that you want to sort by and click **Sort ascending** or **Sort descending**.

{% note %}

**Note:** When a table is sorted, you cannot manually reorder rows.

{% endnote %}

Follow similar steps to remove a sort.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Remove sort-by".
3. Choose **Remove sort-by**.
4. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to the view name and click the menu item that indicates the current sort.

## Grouping by field values

In the table layout, you can group items by a custom field value. When items are grouped, if you drag an item to a new group, the value of that group is applied. For example, if you group by "Status" and then drag an item with a status of `In progress` to the `Done` group, the status of the item will switch to `Done`.

{% note %}

**Note:** Currently, you cannot group by title, assignees, repository or labels.

{% endnote %}

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Group by" or the name of the field you want to group by.
3. Choose the required command. For example, **Group by: Status**.
4. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to the field name that you want to group by and click **Group by values**.

Follow similar steps to remove a grouping.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Remove group-by".
3. Choose **Remove group-by**.
4. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to the view name and click the menu item that indicates the current grouping.

## Filtering rows

Click {% octicon "search" aria-label="the search icon" %} at the top of the table to show the "Filter by keyword or field" bar. Start typing the field name and value that you want to filter by. As you type, possible values will appear.

- To filter for multiple values, separate the values with a comma. For example `label:"good first issue",bug` will list all issues with a label `good first issue` or `bug`.
- To filter for the absence of a specific value, place `-` before your filter. For example, `-label:"bug"` will only show items that do not have the label `bug`.
- To filter for the absence of all values, enter `no:` followed by the field name. For example, `no:assignee` will only show items that do not have an assignee.
- To filter by state, enter `is:`. For example, `is: issue` or `is:open`.
- Separate multiple filters with a space. For example, `status:"In progress" -label:"bug" no:assignee` will show only items that have a status of `In progress`, do not have the label `bug`, and do not have an assignee.

Alternatively, use the command palette.

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Filter by" or the name of the field you want to filter by.
3. Choose the required command. For example, **Filter by Status**.
4. Enter the value that you want to filter for. For example: "In progress". You can also filter for the absence of specific values (for example, choose "Exclude status" then choose a status) or the absence of all values (for example, "No status").

In board layout, you can click on item data to filter for items with that value. For example, click on an assignee to show only items for that assignee. To remove the filter, click the item data again.

## Creating a project view

Project views allow you to quickly view specific aspects of your project. Each view is displayed on a separate tab in your project. 

For example, you can have:
- A view that shows all items not yet started (filter on "Status").
- A view that shows the workload for each team (group by a custom "Team" field).
- A view that shows the items with the earliest target ship date (sort by a date field).

To add a new view:

1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "New view" (to create a new view) or "Duplicate view" (to duplicate the current view).
3. Choose the required command.
4. Alternatively, click {% octicon "plus" aria-label="the plus icon" %} **New view** next to the rightmost view.
5. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to a view name and click **Duplicate view**.

The new view is automatically saved.

## Saving changes to a view

When you make changes to a view - for example, sorting, reordering, filtering, or grouping the data in a view - a dot is displayed next to the view name to indicate that there are unsaved changes. 

![Unsaved changes indicator](/assets/images/help/projects/unsaved-changes.png)

If you don't want to save the changes, you can ignore this indicator. No one else will see your changes.

To save the current configuration of the view for all project members:
1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
1. Start typing "Save view" or "Save changes to new view".
1. Choose the required command.
1. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to a view name and click **Save view** or **Save changes to new view**.

## Reordering saved views

To change the order of the tabs that contain your saved views, click and drag a tab to a new location.

The new tab order is automatically saved.

## Renaming a saved view

To rename a view:
1. Double click the name in the project tab.
1. Change the name.
1. Press Enter, or click outside of the tab.

The name change is automatically saved.

## Deleting a saved view

To delete a view:
1. {% data reusables.projects.open-command-palette %}
2. Start typing "Delete view".
3. Choose the required command.
4. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu next to a view name and click **Delete view**.
