## About automatically generated release notes

Automatically generated release notes provide an automated alternative to manually writing release notes for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} releases. With automatically generated release notes, you can quickly generate an overview of the contents of a release. You can also customize your automated release notes, using labels to create custom categories to organize pull requests you want to include, and exclude certain labels and users from appearing in the output.

## Creating automatically generated release notes for a new release
