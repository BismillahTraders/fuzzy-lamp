{% data reusables.repositories.releases %}
3. To copy a unique URL to your clipboard, find the release you want to link to, right click the title, and copy the URL.
{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae-issue-4974 %}
  ![Release title](/assets/images/help/releases/release-title.png)
{% else %}
  ![Release title](/assets/images/help/releases/release-title-old.png)
{% endif %}
1. Alternatively, right click **Latest Release** and copy the URL to share it. The suffix of this URL is always `/releases/latest`.
   {% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae-issue-4974 %}
   ![Compare release tags menu](/assets/images/help/releases/refreshed-release-latest.png)
   {% else %}
   ![Latest release tag](/assets/images/help/releases/release_latest_release_tag.png)
   {% endif %}
To link directly to a download of your latest release asset that was manually uploaded, link to `/owner/name/releases/latest/download/asset-name.zip`.
