## Renaming a file on {% data variables.product.product_name %}

Renaming a file also gives you the opportunity to [move the file to a new location](/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location)

{% tip %}

**Tips**:

- If you try to rename a file in a repository that you donâ€™t have access to, we will fork the project to your user account and help you send [a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the original repository after you commit your change.
- File names created via the web interface can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`). To use other characters, create and commit the files locally and then push them to the repository.
- Some files, such as images, require that you rename them from the command line. For more information, see "[Renaming a file using the command line](/articles/renaming-a-file-using-the-command-line)."

1. In your repository, browse to the file you want to rename.
2. In the upper right corner of the file view, click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="The edit icon" %} to open the file editor.

3. In the filename field, change the name of the file to the new filename you want. You can also update the contents of your file at the same time.

## Renaming a file using the command line 

You can use the command line to rename any file in your repository.

Many files can be [renamed directly on {% data variables.product.product_name %}](/articles/renaming-a-file), but some files, such as images, require that you rename them from the command line.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}
{% data reusables.command_line.switching_directories_procedural %}
3. Rename the file, specifying the old file name and the new name you'd like to give the file. This will stage your change for commit.
  ```shell
  $ git mv <em>old_filename</em> <em>new_filename</em>
  ```
4. Use `git status` to check the old and new file names.
  ```shell
  $ git status
  > # On branch <em>your-branch</em>
  > # Changes to be committed:
  > #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
  > #
  > #     renamed: <em>old_filename</em> -> <em>new_filename</em>
  > #
  ```
{% data reusables.git.commit-file %}
  ```shell
  $ git commit -m "Rename file"
  # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.
  # {% data reusables.git.reset-head-to-previous-commit-codeblock %}
  ```
{% data reusables.git.git-push %}
