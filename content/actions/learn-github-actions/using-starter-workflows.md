## About starter workflows

{% data variables.product.product_name %} offers starter workflows for a variety of languages and tooling. When you set up workflows in your repository, {% data variables.product.product_name %} analyzes the code in your repository and recommends workflows based on the language and framework in your repository. For example, if you use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), {% data variables.product.product_name %} will suggest a starter workflow file that installs your Node.js packages and runs your tests.{% if actions-starter-template-ui %} You can search and filter to find relevant starter workflows.{% endif %}

You can also create your own starter workflow to share with your organization. These starter workflows will appear alongside the {% data variables.product.product_name %}-provided starter workflows. For more information, see "[Creating starter workflows for your organization](/actions/learn-github-actions/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)."

## Using starter workflows

Anyone with write permission to a repository can set up {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} starter workflows for CI/CD or other automation.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
1. If you already have a workflow in your repository, click **New workflow**.
1. Find the starter workflow that you want to use, then click **Set up this workflow**.{% if actions-starter-template-ui %} To help you find the starter workflow that you want, you can search for keywords or filter by category.{% endif %}
1. If the starter workflow contains comments detailing additional setup steps, follow these steps. Many of the starter workflow have corresponding guides. For more information, see [the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} guides](/actions/guides)."
1. Some starter workflows use secrets. For example, {% raw %}`${{ secrets.npm_token }}`{% endraw %}. If the starter workflow uses a secret, store the value described in the secret name as a secret in your repository. For more information, see "[Encrypted secrets](/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)."
1. Optionally, make additional changes. For example, you might want to change the value of `on` to change when the workflow runs.
1. Click **Start commit**.
1. Write a commit message and decide whether to commit directly to the default branch or to open a pull request.
