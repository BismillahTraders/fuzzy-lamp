## Usage limits

You can set a usage limit for the codespaces in your organization or repository. This limit is applied to the compute and storage usage for {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}:
 
- **Compute minutes:** Compute usage is calculated by the actual number of minutes used by all {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} instances while they are active. These totals are reported to the billing service daily, and is billed monthly. You can set a spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} usage in your organization. For more information, see "[Managing spending limits for Codespaces](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/managing-spending-limits-for-codespaces)."

- **Storage usage:**  For {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} billing purposes, this includes all storage used by all codespaces in your account. This includes all used by the codespaces, such as cloned repositories, configuration files, and extensions, among others. These totals are reported to the billing service daily, and is billed monthly. At the end of the month, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} rounds your storage to the nearest MB.
