## About configuration for repository caching

{% data reusables.enterprise.repository-caching-config-summary %} Then, you can set data location policies that govern which repository networks are replicated to the repository cache.

Repository caching is not supported with clustering.

## DNS for repository caches

The primary instance and repository cache should have different DNS names. For example, if your primary instance is at `github.example.com`, you might decide to name a cache `europe-ci.github.example.com` or `github.asia.example.com`.

To have your CI machines fetch from the repository cache instead of the primary instance, you can use Git's `url.<base>.insteadOf` configuration setting. For more information, see [`git-config`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-urlltbasegtinsteadOf) in the Git documentation. 

For example, the global `.gitconfig` for the CI machine would include these lines.

```
[url "https://europe-ci.github.example.com/"]
	insteadOf = https://github.example.com/
```

Then, when told to fetch `https://github.example.com/myorg/myrepo`, Git will instead fetch from `https://europe-ci.github.example.com/myorg/myrepo`.

## Configuring a repository cache

1. During the beta, you must enable the feature flag for repository caching on your primary {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance.
   
   ```
   $ ghe-config cluster.cache-enabled true
   ```

1. Set up a new {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance on your desired platform. This appliance will be your repository cache. For more information, see "[Setting up a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance](/admin/guides/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.replica-steps %}
1. Connect to the repository cache's IP address using SSH.

   ```shell
   $ ssh -p 122 admin@<em>REPLICA IP</em>
   ```

{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.generate-replication-key-pair %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.add-ssh-key-to-primary %}
1. To verify the connection to the primary and enable replica mode for the repository cache, run `ghe-repl-setup` again.

   ```shell
   $ ghe-repl-setup <em>PRIMARY IP</em>
   ```

1. Set a `cache_location` for the repository cache, replacing *CACHE-LOCATION* with an alphanumeric identifier, such as the region where the cache is deployed.

   ```shell
   $ ghe-repl-node --cache <em>CACHE-LOCATION</em>
   ```

{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.replication-command %}
{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.verify-replication-channel %}
1. To enable replication of repository networks to the repository cache, set a data location policy. For more information, see "[Data location policies](#data-location-policies)."

## Data location policies

You can control data locality by configuring data location policies for your repositories with the `spokesctl cache-policy` command. Data location policies determine which repository networks are replicated on which repository caches. By default, no repository networks will be replicated on any repository caches until a data location policy is configured.

You can configure a policy to replicate all networks with the `--default` flag. For example, this command will create a policy to replicate a single copy of every repository network to the set of repository caches whose `cache_location` is "kansas".

 ```
 $ ghe-spokesctl cache-policy set --default 1 kansas
 ```

To configure replication for a repository network, specify the repository that is the root of the network. A repository network includes a repository and all of the repository's forks. You cannot replicate part of a network without replicating the whole network.

```
$ ghe-spokesctl cache-policy set <owner/repository> 1 kansas
```

You can override a policy that replicates all networks and exclude specific networks by specifying a replica count of zero for the network. For example, this command specifies that any repository cache in location "kansas" cannot contain any copies of that network.

```
$ ghe-spokesctl cache-policy set <owner/repository> 0 kansas
```

Replica counts greater than one in a given cache location are not supported.
