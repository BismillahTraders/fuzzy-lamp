  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - A large number of `gauge-dependency-graph-api-dispatch_dispatch` metrics could accumulate in the Management Console.
    - The sshd service would sometimes fail to start on instances running on Google Cloud Platform.
    - Old upgrade files would persist on the user disk, sometimes resulting in out of space conditions.
    - '`gh-migrator` displayed an incorrect path to its log output.'
    - An export archive would silently fail to import pull requests if they contained review requests from teams not present in the archive.
  changes:
    - Update the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Runner version in GHES 3.1 to [v2.278.0](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.278.0)
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.

      After upgrading from 3.0.x to 3.1.x, in some cases GitHub Actions can fail with an error: `An unexpected error occurred when executing this workflow.` To workaround this problem, connect to the administrative shell (ssh) and run:
      ```
      ghe-actions-console -s actions -c "Queue-ServiceJob -JobId 4DB1F4CF-19FD-40E0-A253-91288813DE8B"
      ```
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
