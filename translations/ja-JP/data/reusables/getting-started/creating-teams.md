Teams are groups of organization members that can be granted permissions to specific repositories as a group. You can create individual teams or multiple levels of nested teams in each of your organizations. For more information, see "[Creating teams](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team)" and "[Adding people to teams](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team)."
