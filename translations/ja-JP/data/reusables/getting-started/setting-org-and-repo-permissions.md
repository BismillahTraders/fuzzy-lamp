We recommend giving a limited number of members in each organization an organization owner role, which provides complete administrative access for that organization. For more information, see "[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

For organizations where you have admin permissions, you can also customize access to each repository with granular permission levels. For more information, see "[Repository permissions levels for an organization](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization)."
