Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`. When a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow deploys to an environment, the environment is displayed on the main page of the repository. You can use environments to require approval for a job to proceed, restrict which branches can trigger a workflow, or limit access to secrets. For more information about creating environments, see "[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/using-environments-for-deployment)."
