## Overview of OpenID Connect

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows are often designed to access a cloud provider (such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or HashiCorp Vault) in order to deploy software or use the cloud's services. Before the workflow can access these resources, it will supply credentials, such as a password or token, to the cloud provider. These credentials are usually stored as a secret in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, and the workflow presents this secret to the cloud provider every time it runs.

However, using hardcoded secrets requires you to create credentials in the cloud provider and then duplicate them in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} as a secret.

With OpenID Connect (OIDC), you can take a different approach by configuring your workflow to request a short-lived access token directly from the cloud provider. Your cloud provider also needs to support OIDC on their end, and you must configure a trust relationship that controls which workflows are able to request the access tokens. Providers that currently support OIDC include Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and HashiCorp Vault, among others.

### Benefits of using OIDC

By updating your workflows to use OIDC tokens, you can adopt the following good security practices:

- **No cloud secrets**: You won't need to duplicate your cloud credentials as long-lived {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} secrets. Instead, you can configure the OIDC trust on your cloud provider, and then update your workflows to request a short-lived access token from the cloud provider through OIDC.
- **Authentication and authorization management**: You have more granular control over how workflows can use credentials, using your cloud provider's authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) tools to control access to cloud resources.
- **Rotating credentials**: With OIDC, your cloud provider issues a short-lived access token that is only valid for a single workflow run, and then automatically expires.

### Getting started with OIDC

The following diagram gives an overview of how {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC provider integrates with your workflows and cloud provider:

![OIDC diagram](/assets/images/help/images/oidc-architecture.png)

1. In your cloud provider, create an OIDC trust between your cloud role and your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} workflow(s) that need access to the cloud.
2. Every time your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow job runs, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC Provider auto-generates an OIDC token. This token contains multiple claims to establish a security-hardened and verifiable identity about the specific workflow that is trying to authenticate.
3. You could include a step or action in your job to request this token from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC provider, and present it to the cloud provider.
4. Once the cloud provider successfully validates the claims presented in the token, it then provides a short-lived cloud access token that is available only for the duration of the job.

## Configuring the OIDC trust with the cloud

When you configure your cloud to trust {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC provider, you **must** add conditions that filter incoming requests, so that untrusted repositories or workflows can’t request access tokens for your cloud resources:

- Before granting an access token, your cloud provider checks that the [`subject`](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) and other claims used to set conditions in its trust settings match those in the request's JSON Web Token (JWT). As a result, you must take care to correctly define the _subject_ and other conditions in your cloud provider.
- The OIDC trust configuration steps and the syntax to set conditions for cloud roles (using _Subject_ and other claims) will vary depending on which cloud provider you're using. For some examples, see "[Examples](#examples)."

### Understanding the OIDC token

Each workflow run requests an OIDC token from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC provider, which responds with an automatically generated JSON web token (JWT) that is unique for each workflow job where it is generated. During a workflow run, the OIDC token is presented to the cloud provider. To validate the token, the cloud provider checks if the OIDC token's subject and other claims are a match for the conditions that were preconfigured on the cloud role's OIDC trust definition.

The following example OIDC token uses a subject (`sub`) that references a job environment named `prod` in the `octo-org/octo-repo` repository.

### Defining trust conditions on cloud roles using OIDC claims

With OIDC, a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow requires a token in order to access resources in your cloud provider. The workflow requests an access token from your cloud provider, which checks the details presented by the JWT. If the trust configuration in the JWT is a match, your cloud provider responds by issuing a temporary token to the workflow, which can then be used to access resources in your cloud provider. You can configure your cloud provider to only respond to requests that originate from a specific organization's repository; you can also specify additional conditions, described below.

Audience and Subject claims are typically used in combination while setting conditions on the cloud role/resources to scope its access to the GitHub workflows.
- **Audience**: By default, this value uses the URL of the organization or repository owner. This can be used to set a condition that only the workflows in the specific organization can access the cloud role.
- **Subject**: Has a predefined format and is a concatenation of some of the key metadata about the workflow, such as the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization, repository, branch or associated [`job`](/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenvironment) environment. There are also many additional claims supported in the OIDC token that can also be used for setting these conditions.

In addition, your cloud provider could allow you to assign a role to the access tokens, letting you specify even more granular permissions.

{% note %}

**Note**: To control how your cloud provider issues access tokens, you **must** define at least one condition, so that untrusted repositories can’t request access tokens for your cloud resources.

{% endnote %}

### サンプル

The following examples demonstrate how to use "Subject" as a condition. The [subject](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) uses information from the workflow run's [`job` context](/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#job-context), and instructs your cloud provider that access token requests may only be granted for requests from workflows running in specific branches, environments. The following sections describe some common subjects you can use.

#### Filtering for a specific environment

You can configure a subject that filters for a specific [environment](/actions/deployment/using-environments-for-deployment) name. In this example, the workflow run must have originated from a job that has an environment named `Production`, in a repository named `octo-repo` that is owned by the `octo-org` organization:

|       |                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 構文:   | `repo:orgName/repoName:environment:environmentName` |
| サンプル: | `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:environment:Production`    |

#### Filtering for `pull_request` events

You can configure a subject that filters for the [`pull_request`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestbranchestags) event. In this example, the workflow run must have been triggered by a `pull_request` event in a repository named `octo-repo` that is owned by the `octo-org` organization:


|       |                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| 構文:   | `repo:orgName/repoName:pull_request`   |
| サンプル: | `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:pull_request` |

#### Filtering for a specific branch

You can configure a subject that filters for a specific branch name. In this example, the workflow run must have originated from a branch named `demo-branch`, in a repository named `octo-repo` that is owned by the `octo-org` organization:

|       |                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 構文:   | `repo:orgName/repoName:ref:refs/heads/branchName`    |
| サンプル: | `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch` |

#### Filtering for a specific tag

You can create a subject that filters for specific tag. In this example, the workflow run must have originated with a tag named `demo-tag`, in a repository named `octo-repo` that is owned by the `octo-org` organization:

|       |                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 構文:   | `repo:orgName/repoName:ref:refs/tags/tagName`    |
| サンプル: | `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/tags/demo-tag` |

### Configuring the subject in your cloud provider

To configure the subject in your cloud provider's trust relationship, you must add the subject string to its trust configuration. The following examples demonstrate how various cloud providers can accept the same `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch` subject in different ways:

|                       |                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon Web Services   | `"token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch"` |
| Azure                 | `repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch`                                              |
| Google Cloud Plafform | `(assertion.sub=='repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch')`                           |
| HashiCorp Vault       | `bound_subject="repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/demo-branch"`                              |

For more information, see the guides listed in "[Enabling OpenID Connect for your cloud provider](#enabling-openid-connect-for-your-cloud-provider)."

## Updating your actions for OIDC

To update your custom actions to authenticate using OIDC, you can use `getIDToken()` from the Actions toolkit to request a JWT from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC provider. For more information, see "OIDC Token" in the [npm package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/core/v/1.6.0).

You could also use a `curl` command to request the JWT, using the following environment variables:
