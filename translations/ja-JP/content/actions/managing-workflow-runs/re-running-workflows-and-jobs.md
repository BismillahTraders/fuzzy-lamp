## Re-running all the jobs in a workflow

Re-running a workflow uses the same `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run. You can re-run a workflow for up to 30 days after the initial run. 

{% include tool-switcher %}

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghae-issue-4721 or ghec %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, use the **Re-run jobs** drop-down menu, and select **Re-run all jobs**

{% ifversion ghes < 3.3 or ghae %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, use the **Re-run jobs** drop-down menu, and select **Re-run all jobs**.

{% endif %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To re-run a failed workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the failed run that you want to re-run.  If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun <em>run-id</em>
```

To view the progress of the workflow run, use the `run watch` subcommand and select the run from the interactive list.

```shell
gh run watch
```

{% endcli %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghae-issue-4721 or ghec %}
### Reviewing previous workflow runs

You can view the results from your previous attempts at running a workflow. You can also view previous workflow runs using the API. For more information, see ["Get a workflow run"](/rest/reference/actions#get-a-workflow-run).

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. Any previous run attempts are shown in the left pane.
    ![Rerun workflow](/assets/images/help/settings/actions-review-workflow-rerun.png)
