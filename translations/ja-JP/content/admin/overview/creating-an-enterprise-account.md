## About enterprise account creation

{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} includes the option to create an enterprise account, which enables collaboration between multiple organizations and gives administrators a single point of visibility and management. 詳細は「[Enterprise アカウントについて](/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts)」を参照してください。

{% data reusables.enterprise.create-an-enterprise-account %} If you pay by invoice, you can create an enterprise account yourself on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. If not, you can [contact our sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_page=/pricing&ref_cta=Contact%20Sales&ref_loc=cards) to move to invoicing.

An enterprise account is included in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, so creating one will not affect your bill.

When you create an enterprise account, your existing organization will automatically be owned by the enterprise account. All current owners of your organization will become owners of the enterprise account. All current billing managers of the organization will become billing managers of the new enterprise account. The current billing details of the organization, including the organization's billing email address, will become billing details of the new enterprise account.
