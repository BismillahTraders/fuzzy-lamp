## {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} について

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}, you can navigate files and source code repositories from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} is available to everyone for free on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} provides many of the benefits of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} settings with the editor. For more information, see "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} documentation.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} runs entirely in your browser’s sandbox. The editor doesn’t clone the repository, but instead uses the [GitHub Repositories extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension) to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browser’s local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.

## Opening the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}

You can open any {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} in either of the following ways:

- Press `.` while browsing any repository or pull request on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
- Change the URL from "github.com" to "github.dev".

## {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} and the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}

Both the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} allow you to edit your code straight from your repository. However, both have slightly different benefits, depending on your use case.

| **Start up**        | The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} opens instantly with a key-press and you can start using it right away, without having to wait for additional configuration or installation. | When you create or resume a codespace, the codespace is assigned a VM and the container is configured based on the contents of a `devcontainer.json` file. This set up may take a few minutes to create the environment. For more information, see "[Creating a Codespace](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)." |
| **Compute**         | There is no associated compute, so you won’t be able to build and run your code or use the integrated terminal.                                                                                   | With  {%  data   variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}, you get the power of dedicated VM on which you can run and debug your application.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Extensions**      | Only a subset of extensions that can run in the web will appear in the Extensions View and can be installed. For more information, see "[Using extensions](#using-extensions)."                   | With Codespaces, you can use most extensions from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Continue working on {%  data   variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}

You can start your workflow in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} and continue working on a codespace, provided you have [access to {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#access-to-codespaces). If you try to access the Run and Debug View or the Terminal, you'll be notified that they are not available in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}.

To continue your work in a codespace, click **Continue Working on…** and select **Create New Codespace** to create a codespace on your current branch. Before you choose this option, you must commit any changes.

## Using source control

When you use the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}, all actions are managed through the Source Control View, which is located in the Activity Bar on the left hand side. For more information on the Source Control View, see "[Version Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} documentation.

Because the web-based editor uses the GitHub Repositories extension to power its functionality, you can switch branches without needing to stash changes. For more information, see "[GitHub Repositories](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} documentation.
