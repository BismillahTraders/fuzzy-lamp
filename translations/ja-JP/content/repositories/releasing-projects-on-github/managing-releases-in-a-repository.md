## About release management

You can create new releases with release notes, @mentions of contributors, and links to binary files, as well as edit or delete existing releases.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
You can also publish an action from a specific release in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. For more information, see "<a href="/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace" class="dotcom-only">Publishing an action in the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}</a>."

You can choose whether {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates for each release. For more information, see "[Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository)."

For example, this command creates a prerelease with the specified title and notes.

   ```shell
   gh release create v1.3.2 --title "v1.3.2 (beta)" --notes "this is a beta release" --prerelease
   ```
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-4972 or ghec %}
