If you have previously contacted {% data variables.contact.enterprise_support %} through the deprecated GitHub Enterprise Support portal, you should use the {% data variables.contact.contact_support_portal %} to open new tickets but you can still view your past tickets at [https://enterprise.githubsupport.com](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com).
