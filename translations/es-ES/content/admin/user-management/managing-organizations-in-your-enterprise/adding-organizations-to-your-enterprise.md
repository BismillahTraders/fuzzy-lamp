## About organizations

Your enterprise account can own organizations. Members of your enterprise can collaborate across related projects within an organization. For more information, see "[About organizations](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)."

Enterprise owners can create new organizations within an enterprise account's settings or invite existing organizations to join an enterprise. To add an organization to your enterprise, you must create the organization from within the enterprise account settings.

You can only add organizations this way to an existing enterprise account. {% data reusables.enterprise.create-an-enterprise-account %} For more information, see "[Creating an enterprise account](/admin/overview/creating-an-enterprise-account)."

## Creating an organization in your enterprise account

New organizations you create within your enterprise account settings are included in your enterprise account's {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} subscription.

Enterprise owners who create an organization owned by the enterprise account automatically become organization owners. For more information about organization owners, see "[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}

6. Click **Finish**.

## Inviting an organization to join your enterprise account

Enterprise owners can invite existing organizations to join their enterprise account. If the organization you want to invite is already owned by another enterprise, you will not be able to issue an invitation until the previous enterprise gives up ownership of the organization. For more information, see "[Removing an organization from your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/removing-organizations-from-your-enterprise)."

2. On the **Organizations** tab, above the list of organizations, click **Invite organization**.
