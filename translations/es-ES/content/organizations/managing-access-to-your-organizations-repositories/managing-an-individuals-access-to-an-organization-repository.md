## About access to organization repositories

When you remove a collaborator from a repository in your organization, the collaborator loses read and write access to the repository. If the repository is private and the collaborator has forked the repository, then their fork is also deleted, but the collaborator will still retain any local clones of your repository.

## Giving a person access to a repository

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-manage-access %}
{% data reusables.organizations.invite-teams-or-people %}
5. In the search field, start typing the name of the person to invite, then click a name in the list of matches.
