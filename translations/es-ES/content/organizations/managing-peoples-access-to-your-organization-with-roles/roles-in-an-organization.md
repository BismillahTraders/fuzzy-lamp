## About roles
{% data reusables.organizations.about-roles %}

Repository-level roles give organization members, outside collaborators and teams of people varying levels of access to repositories. For more information, see "[Repository roles for an organization](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization)."

Team-level roles are roles that give permissions to manage a team. You can give any individual member of a team the team maintainer role, which gives the member a number of administrative permissions over a team. For more information, see "[Assigning the team maintainer role to a team member](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/assigning-the-team-maintainer-role-to-a-team-member)."

Organization-level roles are sets of permissions that can be assigned to individuals or teams to manage an organization and the organization's repositories, teams, and settings. For more information about all the roles available at the organization level, see "[About organization roles](#about-organization-roles)."

## About organization roles

You can assign individuals or teams to a variety of organization-level roles to control your members' access to your organization and its resources. For more details about the individual permissions included in each role, see "[Permissions for organization roles](#permissions-for-organization-roles)."

### Organization owners
Organization owners have complete administrative access to your organization. This role should be limited, but to no less than two people, in your organization. For more information, see "[Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization)."

### Organization members
The default, non-administrative role for people in an organization is the organization member. By default, organization members have a number of permissions, including the ability to create repositories and project boards.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
### Billing managers
Billing managers are users who can manage the billing settings for your organization, such as payment information. This is a useful option if members of your organization don't usually have access to billing resources. For more information, see "[Adding a billing manager to your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization)."

{% endif %}

{% if security-managers %}
### Security managers

{% data reusables.organizations.security-manager-beta-note %}

{% data reusables.organizations.about-security-managers %}

If your organization has a security team, you can use the security manager role to give members of the team the least access they need to the organization. For more information, see "[Managing security managers in your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization)."
{% endif %}
### {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} managers
By default, only organization owners can manage the settings of {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by an organization. To allow additional users to manage {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by an organization, an owner can grant them {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager permissions.

When you designate a user as a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} manager in your organization, you can grant them access to manage the settings of some or all {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by the organization. For more information, see:

- "[Adding GitHub App managers in your organization](/articles/adding-github-app-managers-in-your-organization)"
- "[Removing GitHub App managers from your organization](/articles/removing-github-app-managers-from-your-organization)"

### Outside collaborators
To keep your organization's data secure while allowing access to repositories, you can add *outside collaborators*. {% data reusables.organizations.outside_collaborators_description %}

## Permissions for organization roles

{% ifversion fpt %}
Some of the features listed below are limited to organizations using {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. {% data reusables.enterprise.link-to-ghec-trial %}
{% endif %}
