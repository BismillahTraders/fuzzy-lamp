For choice and flexibility in how and when you use {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can configure theme settings to change how {% data variables.product.product_name %} looks to you. You can choose from themes that are light or dark, or you can configure {% data variables.product.product_name %} to follow your system settings.

You may want to use a dark theme to reduce power consumption on certain devices, to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions, or because you prefer how the theme looks.

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghae-issue-4618 or ghec %}If you have low vision, you may benefit from a high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements.{% endif %}{% ifversion fpt or ghae-issue-4619 or ghec %} If you have colorblindness, you may benefit from our light and dark colorblind themes.

{% note %}

**Note:** The colorblind themes and light high contrast theme are currently in public beta. For more information on enabling features in public beta, see "[Exploring early access releases with feature preview](/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview)."
