## About continuous deployment

_Continuous deployment_ (CD) is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates. As part of the typical CD process, the code is automatically built and tested before deployment.

Continuous deployment is often coupled with continuous integration. For more information about continuous integration, see "[About continuous integration](/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration)".

## About continuous deployment using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

You can set up a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to deploy your software product. To verify that your product works as expected, your workflow can build the code in your repository and run your tests before deploying.

You can configure your CD workflow to run when a {% data variables.product.product_name %} event occurs (for example, when new code is pushed to the default branch of your repository), on a set schedule, manually, or when an external event occurs using the repository dispatch webhook. For more information about when your workflow can run, see "[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes > 3.0 or ghec %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} provides features that give you more control over deployments. For example, you can use environments to require approval for a job to proceed, restrict which branches can trigger a workflow, or limit access to secrets. {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghes > 3.1 or ghec %}You can use concurrency to limit your CD pipeline to a maximum of one in-progress deployment and one pending deployment. {% endif %}For more information about these features, see "[Deploying with GitHub Actions](/actions/deployment/deploying-with-github-actions)" and "[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/using-environments-for-deployment)."{% endif %}
