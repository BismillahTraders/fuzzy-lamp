You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For example:

  * `action:team` finds all events grouped within the team category.
  * `-action:hook` excludes all events in the webhook category.

Each category has a set of associated actions that you can filter on. For example:

  * `action:team.create` finds all events where a team was created.
  * `-action:hook.events_changed` excludes all events where the events on a webhook have been altered.

### Search based on time of action

Use the `created` qualifier to filter events in the audit log based on when they occurred. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

For example:

  * `created:2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:>=2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:<=2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on or before July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31` finds all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.


{% note %}

**Note**: The audit log contains data for the current month and every day of the previous six months.

{% endnote %}

### Search based on location

Using the qualifier `country`, you can filter events in the audit log based on the originating country. You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name. Keep in mind that countries with spaces in their name will need to be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:

  * `country:de` finds all events that occurred in Germany.
  * `country:Mexico` finds all events that occurred in Mexico.
  * `country:"United States"` all finds events that occurred in the United States.

## Exporting the audit log

{% data reusables.audit_log.export-log %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.exported-log-keys-and-values %}
{% endif %}

## Using the audit log API

You can interact with the audit log using the GraphQL API{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or the REST API{% endif %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
The audit log API requires {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.{% ifversion fpt %} {% data reusables.enterprise.link-to-ghec-trial %}{% endif %}

### Using the GraphQL API

{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note**: The audit log GraphQL API is available for organizations using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}. {% data reusables.gated-features.more-info-org-products %}

{% endnote %}

To ensure your intellectual property is secure, and you maintain compliance for your organization, you can use the audit log GraphQL API to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
{% data reusables.audit_log.audit-log-api-info %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
Note that you can't retrieve Git events using the GraphQL API. To retrieve Git events, use the REST API instead. For more information, see "[`git` category actions](#git-category-actions)."
{% endif %}

The GraphQL response can include data for up to 90 to 120 days.

For example, you can make a GraphQL request to see all the new organization members added to your organization. For more information, see the "[GraphQL API Audit Log]({% ifversion ghec%}/free-pro-team@latest{% endif %}/graphql/reference/interfaces#auditentry/)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

### Using the REST API

{% note %}

**Note:** The audit log REST API is available for users of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} only.

{% endnote %}

To ensure your intellectual property is secure, and you maintain compliance for your organization, you can use the audit log REST API to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
{% data reusables.audit_log.audited-data-list %}

{% data reusables.audit_log.audit-log-git-events-retention %}

For more information about the audit log REST API, see "[Organizations](/rest/reference/orgs#get-the-audit-log-for-an-organization)."
