### Tax identification numbers

The W-8 BEN and W-8 BEN-E tax forms ask for a "U.S. taxpayer identification number (SSN or ITIN)" or "Foreign tax identifying number".

If you are not a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person, including a resident alien individual, then you will usually need to provide the "Foreign tax identifying number". This is a tax identification number that your country of residence has issued you.

If your country of residence or billing country is India, then you can use your Permanent Account Number (PAN) as your tax identification number.

**Note:** If your country does not require citizens to have a tax number issued by the government, then you can instead write "not legally required".

Guidance from the IRS states that you should not write "not applicable." For more information, see "[Instructions for Form W-8BEN, Line 6](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw8ben#idm139867098922656)" on the IRS website.

## Sales tax

GitHub is providing information to assist you in calculating your sales tax obligations. This information is not personalized to your country or tax situation and we recommend you talk to a professional to understand your specific obligations. However, we'd like to provide some high-level information to help you understand the general principles of digital sales tax.

In most countries around the world, sales tax for digital transactions is based on the location of the recipient, not on the seller. For example, if you are a maintainer in the United States and you provide a taxable benefit to a Sponsor in Germany, German sales tax would apply.

Sales tax is generally only applicable when a good or service of value is being provided. Goodwill/general support/undying appreciation is not normally taxable.

In the US, both B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer) are subject to sales tax.

In the EU and most other countries and regions, B2C sales are subject to sales tax. B2B sales are not subject to tax. C2C and C2B sales where a consumer is not registered for VAT are not taxable.
