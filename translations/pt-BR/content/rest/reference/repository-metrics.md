## Community

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'community' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

## Statistics

The Repository Statistics API allows you to fetch the data that {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses for visualizing different
types of repository activity.

### A word about caching

Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached
data whenever possible.  If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's
statistics, you'll receive a `202` response; a background job is also fired to
start compiling these statistics. Give the job a few moments to complete, and
then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a
`200` response with the statistics in the response body.

Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.

### Statistics exclude some types of commits

The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-repository-graphs).

To summarize:
- All statistics exclude merge commits.
- Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'statistics' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## Traffic

For repositories that you have push access to, the traffic API provides access
to the information provided in your repository graph. For more information, see "<a href="/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-traffic-to-a-repository" class="dotcom-only">Viewing traffic to a repository</a>."
