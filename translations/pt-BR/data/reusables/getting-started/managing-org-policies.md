You can manage permissions and policies for a number of different actions and features in your organization.

For example, to protect your organization's data and number of paid licenses, you can choose to allow only organization owners to invite outside collaborators to organization repositories. You can also choose to allow or prevent the forking of private repositories owned by your organization. For more information, see "[Setting permissions for adding outside collaborators](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/setting-permissions-for-adding-outside-collaborators)" and "[Managing the forking policy for your organization](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization)."

For the full list of settings you can configure for your organization, see "[Managing organization settings](/organizations/managing-organization-settings)."
