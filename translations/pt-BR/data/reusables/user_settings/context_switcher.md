You must manage billing settings and paid features for each of your accounts separately. You can switch between settings for your personal account, organization accounts, and enterprise accounts using the context switcher on each settings page. For more information, see "[Switching between settings for your different accounts](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts)."
