      heading: 'Git Credential Manager (GCM) secure credential storage and multi-factor authentication support'
      notes:
        - |
          Git Credential Manager (GCM) versions 2.0.452 and later now provide security-hardened credential storage and multi-factor authentication support for {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

          GCM with support for {% data variables.product.product_name %} is included with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) versions 2.32 and later. GCM is not included with Git for macOS or Linux, but can be installed separately. For more information, see the [latest release](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/) and [installation instructions](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/) in the `GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager` repository.
  changes:
    - 
      heading: Alterações na administração
      notes:
        - A 'User Agent Referrer Policy' setting has been added to the enterprise settings. This allows an admin to set a stricter `Referrer-Policy` to hide the hostname of a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} installation from external sites. The setting is disabled by default and is tracked by audit log events for staff and enterprise owners when enabled or disabled. For more information, see "[Configuring Referrer Policy for your enterprise](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-the-referrer-policy-for-your-enterprise)."
        - The MySQL health check was changed to use `mysqladmin ping` instead of TCP checks, which removes some unnecessary noise in the MySQL error log. Also, Orchestrator failover checks were improved to prevent unnecessary MySQL failovers when applying cluster config changes.
        - 'The Resque service, which supports background job processing, has been replaced with Aqueduct Lite. This change makes the job system easier to manage and should not affect the user experience. For the new administration and debugging commands for Aqueduct, see "[Command-line utilities](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-aqueduct)."'
    - 
      heading: Token Changes
      notes:
        - |
          The format of authentication tokens for {% data variables.product.product_name %} has changed. The change affects the format of personal access tokens and access tokens for {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}, as well as user-to-server, server-to-server, and refresh tokens for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}.

          The different token types now have unique identifiable prefixes, which allows for secret scanning to detect the tokens so that you can mitigate the impact of someone accidentally committing a token to a repository. {% data variables.product.company_short %} recommends updating existing tokens as soon as possible. For more information, see "[About authentication to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#githubs-token-formats)" and "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}](/code-security/secret-security/about-secret-scanning)."
    - 
      heading: 'Repositories changes'
      notes:
        - Repositories on user profiles and organization profiles now support sorting by star count.
        - When viewing the commit history of a single file, you can now click {% octicon "file-code" aria-label="The code icon" %} to view that file at the selected point in history.
        - When a submodule is defined with a relative path in {% data variables.product.product_location %}, the submodule is now clickable in the web UI. Clicking the submodule in the web UI will take you to the linked repository. Previously, only submodules with absolute URLs were clickable. This is supported for relative paths for repositories with the same owner that follow the pattern <code>../<em>REPOSITORY</em></code> or relative paths for repositories with a different owner that follow the pattern <code>../<em>OWNER</em>/<em>REPOSITORY</em></code>. For more information about working with submodules, see [Working with submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) on {% data variables.product.prodname_blog %}.
        - 'The web UI can now be used to synchronize an out-of-date branch of a fork with the fork''s upstream branch. If there are no merge conflicts between the branches, the branch is updated either by fast-forwarding or by merging from upstream. If there are conflicts, you will be prompted to create a pull request to resolve the conflicts. For more information, see "[Syncing a fork](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-from-the-web-ui)."'
    - 
      heading: 'Markdown changes'
      notes:
        - 'The markdown editor used when creating or editing a release in a repository now has a text-editing toolbar. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)."'
        - Uploading video files is now supported everywhere you write Markdown on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Share demos, reproduction steps, and more in your issue and pull request comments, as well as in Markdown files within repositories, such as READMEs. For more information, see "[Attaching files](/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files)."
        - Markdown files will now automatically generate a table of contents in the header when there are 2 or more headings. The table of contents is interactive and links to the selected section. All 6 Markdown heading levels are supported.
        - 'There is a new keyboard shortcut, `cmd+e` on macOS or `ctrl+e` on Windows, to insert codeblocks in Markdown files, issues, pull requests, and comments.'
        - 'Appending `?plain=1` to the URL for any Markdown file will now display the file without rendering and with line numbers. The plain view can be used to link other users to specific lines. For example, appending `?plain=1#L52` will highlight line 52 of a plain text Markdown file. For more information, "[Creating a permanent link to a code snippet](/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet#linking-to-markdown)."'
    - 
      heading: 'Issues and pull requests changes'
      notes:
        - With the [latest version of Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons/releases), the states of issues and pull requests are now more visually distinct so you can scan their status more easily. For more information, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_blog %}](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-08-new-issue-and-pull-request-state-icons/).
        - 'A new "Require conversation resolution before merging" branch protection rule and "Conversations" menu is now available. Easily discover your pull request comments from the "Files changed" tab, and require that all your pull request conversations are resolved before merging. For more information, see "[About pull request reviews](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#discovering-and-navigating-conversations)" and "[About protected branches](/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-conversation-resolution-before-merging)."'
        - To prevent the merge of unexpected changes after auto-merge is enabled for a pull request, auto-merge is now disabled automatically when new changes are pushed by a user without write access to the repository. Users without write access can still update the pull request with changes from the base branch when auto-merge is enabled. To prevent a malicious user from using a merge conflict to introduce unexpected changes to the pull request, auto-merge for the pull request is disabled if the update causes a merge conflict. For more information about auto-merge, see "[Automatically merging a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)."
        - 'People with maintain permissions can now manage the repository-level "Allow auto-merge" setting. This setting, which is off by default, controls whether auto-merge is available on pull requests in the repository. Previously, only people with admin permissions could manage this setting. Additionally, this setting can now by controlled using the "[Create a repository](/rest/reference/repos#create-an-organization-repository)" and "[Update a repository](/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository)" REST APIs. For more information, see "[Managing auto-merge for pull requests in your repository](/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository)."'
        - The assignees selection for issues and pull requests now supports type ahead searching so you can find users in your organization faster. Additionally, search result rankings have been updated to prefer matches at the start of a person's username or profile name.
        - When a review is requested from a team of more than 100 people, developers are now shown a confirmation dialog box in order to prevent unnecessary notifications for large teams.
        - Back-tick `code blocks` are now supported in issue titles, pull request titles, and in any place issue and pull request titles are referenced in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}.
        - 'Events for pull requests and pull request reviews are now included in the audit log for both [enterprises](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/auditing-users-across-your-enterprise) and [organizations](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization). These events help admins better monitor pull request activity and help ensure security and compliance requirements are being met. Events can be viewed from the web UI, exported as CSV or JSON, or accessed via REST API. You can also search the audit log for specific pull request events. For more information, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#pull_request-category-actions)."'
    - 
      heading: 'Branches changes'
      notes:
        - |
          The default branch name for new repositories is now `main`. Existing repositories are not impacted by this change. If users, organization owners, or enterprise owners have previously specified a default branch for new repositories, they are also not impacted.

          If you want to set a different default branch name, you can do so in the [user](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories), [organization](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-repositories-in-your-organization), or [enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-on-the-default-branch-name) settings.
        - |
          Branches, including the default branch, can now be renamed using the the {% data variables.product.product_name %} web UI. When a branch is renamed, any open pull requests and draft releases targeting the renamed branch will be retargeted automatically, and branch protection rules that explicitly reference the renamed branch will be updated.

          Admin permissions are required to rename the default branch, but write permissions are sufficient to rename other branches.

          To help make the change as seamless as possible for users:

          * A notice is shown to contributors, maintainers, and admins on the repository homepage with instructions for updating their local repository.
          * Web requests to the old branch will be redirected.
          * A "moved permanently" HTTP response will be returned to REST API calls.
          * An informational message is displayed to Git command line users that push to the old branch.

          For more information, see "[Renaming a branch](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch)."

      heading: 'GitHub Actions changes'
      notes:
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} now lets you control the permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an automatically-generated secret that lets you make authenticated calls to the API for {% data variables.product.product_name %} in your workflow runs. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} generates a new token for each job and expires the token when a job completes. The token usually has `write` permissions to a number of [API endpoints](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token), except in the case of pull requests from forks, which are always `read`. These new settings allow you to follow a principle of least privilege in your workflows. For more information, see "[Authentication in a workflow](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token)."'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} 1.9 and later allows you to work with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} in your terminal.

      heading: 'GitHub Packages changes'
      notes:
        - Any package or package version for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} can now be deleted from {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s web UI. You can also undo the deletion of any package or package version within 30 days. For more information, see "[Deleting and restoring a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package)".
    - 
      heading: 'Dependabot and Dependency graph changes'
      notes:
        - 'The dependency graph can now be enabled using the Management Console, rather than needing to run a command in the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Enabling alerts for vulnerable dependencies {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/admin/configuration/managing-connections-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud/enabling-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies-on-github-enterprise-server#enabling-the-dependency-graph-and-dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies-on-github-enterprise-server)."'
        - Notifications for multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} are now grouped together if they're discovered at the same time. This significantly reduces the volume of {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert notifications that users receive. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-03-18-grouped-dependabot-alert-notifications/).
        - 'Dependency graph and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} now support Go modules. {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} analyzes a repository''s `go.mod` files to understand the repository’s dependencies.

For more information about enabling the dependency graph on private repositories, see "[Securing your repository](/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository#managing-the-dependency-graph)."'
        - The default notification settings for security alerts have changed. Previously, if you had permission to view security alerts in a repository, you would receive notifications for that repository as long as your settings allowed for security alert notifications. Now, you must opt in to security alert notifications by watching the repository. You will be notified if you select `All Activity` or configure `Custom` to include `Security alerts`. All existing repositories will be automatically migrated to these new settings and you will continue to receive notifications; however, any new repositories will require opting-in by watching the repository.

        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} now includes beta support for analyzing C++20 code. This is only available when building codebases with GCC on Linux. C++20 modules are not supported yet.'
        - The depth of {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}'s analysis has been improved by adding support for more [libraries and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) and increasing the coverage of our existing library and framework models for several languages ([C++](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp), [JavaScript](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/javascript), [Python](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/python), and [Java](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/java)). As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, review the steps through which that data flows, and identify potentially dangerous sinks in which this data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-01-codeql-code-scanning-now-recognizes-more-sources-and-uses-of-untrusted-user-data/).

          {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} now shows `security-severity` levels for CodeQL security alerts. You can configure which `security-severity` levels will cause a check failure for a pull request. The severity level of security alerts can be `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`. By default, any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a `security-severity` of `critical` or `high` will cause a pull request check failure.

          Additionally, you can now also configure which severity levels will cause a pull request check to fail for non-security alerts. You can configure this behavior at the repository level, and define whether alerts with the severity `error`, `warning`, or `note` will cause a pull request check to fail. By default, non-security {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with a severity of `error` will cause a pull request check failure.

          For more information see "[Defining which alert severity levels cause pull request check failure](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure)."

          Improvements to the branch filter for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts make it clearer which {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are being displayed on the alerts page. By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts are filtered to show alerts for the default branch of the repository only. You can use the branch filter to display the alerts on any of the non-default branches. Any branch filter that has been applied is shown in the search bar.

          The search syntax has also been simplified to `branch:<branch name>`. This syntax can be used multiple times in the search bar to filter on multiple branches. The previous syntax, `ref:refs/heads/<branch name>`, is still supported, so any saved URLs will continue to work.

          Free text search is now available for code scanning alerts. You can search code scanning results to quickly find specific alerts without having to know exact search terms. The search is applied across the alert's name, description, and help text. The syntax is:

          - A single word returns all matches.
          - Multiple search words returns matches to either word.
          - Words in double quotes returns exact matches.
          - The keyword 'AND' returns matches to multiple words.

      heading: Alterações de API
      notes:
        - 'Pagination support has been added to the Repositories REST API''s "compare two commits" endpoint, which returns a list of commits reachable from one commit or branch, but unreachable from another. The API can also now return the results for comparisons over 250 commits. For more information, see the "[Commits](/rest/reference/commits#compare-two-commits)" REST API documentation and "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."'
        - 'The REST API can now be used to programmatically resend or check the status of webhooks. For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos#webhooks)," "[Organizations](/rest/reference/orgs#webhooks)," and "[Apps](/rest/reference/apps#webhooks)" in the REST API documentation.'

          Improvements have been made to the code scanning and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} APIs:

          - The code scanning API now returns the CodeQL query version used for an analysis. This can be used to reproduce results or confirm that an analysis used the latest query. For more information, see "[Code scanning](/rest/reference/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)" in the REST API documentation.
          - Admin users can now use the REST API to enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for repositories, using the `security_and_analysis` object on `repos/{org}/{repo}`. In addition, admin users can check whether {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} is currently enabled for a repository by using a `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` request. These changes help you manage {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} repository access at scale. For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository)" in the REST API documentation.

  known_issues:
    - Em uma nova configuração de {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} sem qualquer usuário, um invasor pode criar o primeiro usuário administrador.
    - As regras de firewall personalizadas são removidas durante o processo de atualização.
    - Arquivos LFS do Git [enviados através da interface web](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) são adicionados diretamente ao repositório e de forma incorreta.
    - Os problemas não podem ser fechados se contiverem um permalink para um blob no mesmo repositório, onde o caminho do arquivo blob's é maior que 255 caracteres.
    - Quando "Usuários podem pesquisar pelo GitHub.com" está habilitado com o GitHub Connect, os problemas em repositórios privados e internos não estão incluídos nos resultados de pesquisa do GitHub.com.
    - O registro npm de {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} não retorna mais o valor de tempo em respostas de metadados. Isso foi feito para permitir melhorias substanciais de desempenho. Continuamos a ter todos os dados necessários para devolver um valor de tempo como parte da resposta aos metadados e retomaremos o retorno desse valor no futuro, assim que tivermos resolvido os problemas de desempenho existentes.
    - Os limites de recursos que são específicos para processamento de hooks pre-receive podem causar falha em alguns hooks pre-receive.

      heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication via query parameters
      notes:
        - |
          To prevent accidental logging or exposure of `access_tokens`, we discourage the use of OAuth Application API endpoints and the use of API auth via query params. Visit the following posts to see the proposed replacements:

          * [Replacement OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#changes-to-make)
          * [Replacement auth via headers instead of query param](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make)

          These endpoints and auth route are planned to be removed from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.

      heading: Removal of legacy GitHub App webhook events and endpoints
      notes:
        - |
          Two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events have been removed: `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories`. You should instead be listening to the `installation` and `installation_repositories` events.
        - |
          The following REST API endpoint has been removed: `POST /installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens`. You should instead be using the namespaced equivalent `POST /app/installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens`.
  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.2 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.2.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/configuration/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'
