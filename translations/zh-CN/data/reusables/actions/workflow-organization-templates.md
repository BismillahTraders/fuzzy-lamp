Workflow templates allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When you create a new workflow, you can choose a template and some or all of the work of writing the workflow will be done for you. 您可以使用工作流程模板作为基础来构建自定义工作流程，或按原样使用模板。 This not only saves time, it promotes consistency and best practice across your organization.
