You can create default community health files, such as a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, or even issue and pull request templates, for your organization. These default files will be used for any repository owned by your organization that does not contain its own file of that type. 更多信息请参阅“[创建默认社区健康文件](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)”。
