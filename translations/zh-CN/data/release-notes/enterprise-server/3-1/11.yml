  security_fixes:
    - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} builds on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} that could allow an attacker to read system files. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needed permission to create and build a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} prior to 3.3, and was fixed in versions 3.0.19, 3.1.11, and 3.2.3. This vulnerability was reported through the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22870.
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - Some Git operations failed after upgrading a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.x cluster because of the HAProxy configuration.
    - Unicorn worker counts might have been set incorrectly in clustering mode.
    - Resqued worker counts might have been set incorrectly in clustering mode.
    - If Ubuntu's Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) status was inactive, a client could not clearly see it in the logs.
    - Upgrading from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.x to 3.x failed when there were UTF8 characters in an LDAP configuration.
    - Some pages and Git-related background jobs might not run in cluster mode with certain cluster configurations.
    - 'When a new tag was created, the [push](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) webhook payload did not display a correct `head_commit` object. Now, when a new tag is created, the push webhook payload now always includes a `head_commit` object that contains the data of the commit that the new tag points to. As a result, the `head_commit` object will always contain the commit data of the payload''s `after` commit.'
    - The enterprise audit log page would not display audit events for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}.
    - There was an insufficient job timeout for replica repairs.
    - 'Users were not warned about potentially dangerous bidirectional unicode characters when viewing files. For more information, see "[Warning about bidirectional Unicode text](https://github.co/hiddenchars)" in {% data variables.product.prodname_blog %}.'
    - Hookshot Go sent distribution type metrics that Collectd could not handle, which caused a ballooning of parsing errors.
  changes:
    - Kafka configuration improvements have been added. When deleting repositories, package files are now immediately deleted from storage account to free up space. `DestroyDeletedPackageVersionsJob` now deletes package files from storage account for stale packages along with metadata records.
  known_issues:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
