  security_fixes:
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - The counts on packages pages were not being incremented when a package was downloaded.
    - '`ghe-config-apply` would timeout, ask for a prompt or fail for a customer that had {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} enabled, and had either disabled or never enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on their instance.'
    - Log files were not reopened after rotation in some cases leading to high disk space usage on instances with high uptime.
    - Upgrade could fail from older version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} due to a missing job in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.
    - 'Custom pre-receive hooks could lead to an error like `error: object directory /data/user/repositories/0/nw/12/34/56/7890/network.git/objects does not exist; check .git/objects/info/alternates`.'
    - Unauthenticated HTTP proxy for the pages containers build was not supported for any users that use HTTP proxies.
    - A significant number of 503 errors were logged every time a user visited a repository's `/settings` page if the dependency graph was not enabled.
    - Internal repositories were only returned when a user had affiliations with the repository through a team or through collaborator status, or queried with the `?type=internal` parameter.
    - Failed background jobs had unlimited retries which could cause large queue depths.
    - A significant number of 503 errors were being created if the scheduled job to sync vulnerabilities with GitHub.com attempted to run when dependency graph was not enabled and content analysis was enabled.

      When {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}  is enabled without running regular scheduled backups, the MSSQL transaction log could grow unbounded and can consume all available space on the appliance's data disk, causing a possible outage.

      If you have configured regularly scheduled MSSQL backups, no further actions is required. Otherwise, if you have {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} previously enabled, run the following commands after installing this patch.

      ```
      ghe-actions-console -s Mps -c 'Update-Service -Force'
      ghe-actions-console -s Token -c 'Update-Service -Force'
      ghe-actions-console -s Actions -c 'Update-Service -Force'
      ```
  changes:
    - The logs for `babeld` now include a `cmd` field for HTTP ref advertisement requests instead of only including it during the negotiation requests.
  known_issues:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
