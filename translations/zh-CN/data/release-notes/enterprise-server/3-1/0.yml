  features:
    - heading: GitHub Advanced Security Secret Scanning
      notes:
        - |
          [Secret Scanning](https://github.com/features/security) is now generally available on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1+. Scan public and private repositories for committed credentials, find secrets, and notify the secret provider or admin the moment they are committed into a repository.

          This release includes several improvements from the beta of Secret Scanning on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}:

          - Expanded our [pattern coverage](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/secret-security/about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning-for-private-repositories) from 24 partners to 37
          - Added an [API](/rest/reference/secret-scanning) and [webhooks](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#secret_scanning_alert)
          - Added [notifications for commit authors](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-03-05-secret-scanning-notifications-for-commit-authors-on-private-repositories/) when they commit secrets
          - Updated the index view to made it easy to triage secrets in bulk
          - Reduced the false positive rate on many patterns

          Administrators using {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} can [enable and configure](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/configuration/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance) {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} secret scanning. You can review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} secret scanning.

    - heading: GitHub Advanced Security billing improvements
      notes:
        - |
          This release includes several improvements to {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} billing in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}:

          - {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} customers can now view their active committer count and the remaining number of unused committer seats on their organization or enterprise accountâ€™s Billing page. If Advanced Security is purchased for an enterprise, administrators can also view the active committer seats which are being used by other organizations within their enterprise. For more information, see "[About GitHub Advanced Security licensing](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/advanced-security/about-licensing-for-github-advanced-security)" and "[Viewing your GitHub Advanced Security usage](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/advanced-security/viewing-your-github-advanced-security-usage)."
          - GitHub Advanced Security customers can now view their active committer count for any Advanced Security enabled repositories on their organization or enterprise account's Billing page. These changes help billing administrators track their usage against how many committer licenses they purchased. For more information see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/enterprise-server@3.1/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)."

    - heading: Dependabot improvements
      notes:
        - |
          This release includes improvements to Dependabot alerts in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}:

          - Users with Dependabot alerts enabled can see which of their repositories are impacted by a given vulnerability by navigating to its entry in the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). This feature is available in public beta. For more information, see "[Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository)."
          - When a vulnerability is added to GitHub Advisory Database, you will no longer receive [email and web notifications](https://github.com/notifications) for Dependabot alerts on low and moderate severity vulnerabilities. These alerts are still accessible from the repository's Security tab. For more information, see "[Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository)."
          - You can now give people instructions on how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities in your project by adding a `SECURITY.md` file to your repository's `root`, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy. For more information, see "[Adding a security policy to your repository](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)."

    - heading: GitHub Actions Workflow Visualization beta
      notes:
        - |
          {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can now generate a visual graph of your workflow on every run. With workflow visualization, you can:
          - View and understand complex workflows
          - Track progress of workflows in real-time
          - Troubleshoot runs quickly by easily accessing logs and jobs metadata
          - Monitor progress of deployment jobs and easily access deployment targets

          For more information, see "[Using the visualization graph](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/using-the-visualization-graph)."

    - heading: OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
      notes:
        - |
          [OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant](https://github.com/login/device) allows any CLI client or developer tool to authenticate using a secondary system with a browser.

          Administrators using [OAuth Apps](/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow) and [GitHub Apps](/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow) can enable and configure OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow, in addition to the existing Web Application Flow. You can review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you enable OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow.

    - heading: Pull request auto-merge
      notes:
        - |
          With auto-merge, pull requests can be set to merge automatically when all merge requirements have been satisfied. This saves users from needing to constantly check the state of their pull requests just to merge them. Auto-merge can be enabled by a user with permission to merge and on pull requests that have unsatisfied merge requirements. For more information, see "[Automatically merging a pull request](/enterprise-server@3.1/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)."

    - heading: Custom notifications
      notes:
        - |
          You can customize the types of notifications you want to receive from individual repositories. For more information, see "[Configuring notifications](/enterprise-server@3.1/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository)."

    - heading: GitHub Mobile filtering
      notes:
        - |
          [{% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}](https://github.com/mobile) filtering allows you to search for and find issues, pull requests, and discussions from your device. New metadata for issues and pull request list items allow you to filter by assignees, checks status, review states, and comment counts.

          {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} beta is available for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. Sign in with our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/github/id1477376905) apps to triage notifications and manage issues and pull requests on the go. Administrators can disable mobile support for their Enterprise using the management console or by running `ghe-config app.mobile.enabled false`. For more information, see "[GitHub Mobile](/get-started/using-github/github-mobile)."

  changes:
    - heading: Administration Changes
      notes:
        - By precomputing checksums, the amount of time a repository is under the lock has reduced dramatically, allowing more write operations to succeed immediately and improving monorepo performance.
        - The latest release of the CodeQL CLI supports uploading analysis results to GitHub. This makes it easier to run code analysis for customers who wish to use CI/CD systems other than {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Previously, such users had to use the separate CodeQL runner, which will continue to be available. For more information, see "[About CodeQL code scanning in your CI system](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/secure-coding/about-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system)."
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} now supports skipping `push` and `pull_request` workflows by looking for some common keywords in your commit message.'
        - Check annotations older than four months will be archived.

    - heading: Security Changes
      notes:
        - Following feedback, display of Code Scanning results on a pull request without submitting with a pull request ID will remain supported. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/secure-coding/configuring-code-scanning#scanning-pull-requests)" and "[Configuring CodeQL code scanning in your CI system](/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/secure-coding/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#scanning-pull-requests).
        - SARIF upload support increased to a maximum of 5000 results per upload.

    - heading: Developer Changes
      notes:
        - You can specify multiple callback URLs while configuring a GitHub App. This can be used in services with multiple domains or subdomains. GitHub will always deny authorization if the callback URL from the request is not in the authorization callback URL list.
        - The GitHub App file permission has been updated to allow an app developer to specify up to 10 files for read-only or read-write access that their app can request access to.
        - CodeQL now supports more [libraries and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) for a variety of languages ([C++](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/cpp), [JavaScript](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/javascript), [Python](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/python),[Java](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/java), [Go](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/tree/main)). The CodeQL engine can now detect more sources of untrusted user data, which improves the quality and depth of the code scanning alerts. For more information, see "[About CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/)."
        - When configuring a GitHub App, the authorization callback URL is a required field. Now, we allow the developer to specify multiple callback URLs. This can be used in services with multiple domains or subdomains. GitHub will always deny authorization if the callback URL from the request is not in the authorization callback URL list.
        - Delete an entire directory of files, including subdirectories, from your web browser. For more information, see "[Deleting a file or directory](/enterprise-server@3.1/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/deleting-files-in-a-repository#deleting-a-directory)."
        - 'Include multiple words after the `#` in an issue, discussion, or pull request comment to further narrow your search.'
        - 'When youâ€™re writing an issue, pull request, or discussion comment the list syntax for bullets, numbers, and tasks autocompletes after you press `return` or `enter`.'

    - heading: API Changes
      notes:
        - The code scanning API allows users to upload data about static analysis security testing results, or export data about alerts. For more information, see the [code scanning API reference](/rest/reference/code-scanning).
        - The [GitHub Apps API](/rest/reference/apps) for managing installations has now graduated from an API preview to a generally available API. The [preview header](/rest/overview/api-previews) is no longer required to access these endpoints.

  security_fixes:
    - '**MEDIUM** Under certain circumstances, users who were removed from a team or organization could retain write access to branches they had existing pull requests opened for.'
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.

  bugs:
    - heading: Fixes for known issues from Release Candidate
      notes:
        - All known issues from Release Candidate 1 have been fixed, except those listed in the Known Issues section below.
    - heading: Fixes for other issues
      notes:
        - On the "Configure Actions and Packages" page of the initial installation process, clicking on the "Test domain settings" button did not complete the test.
        - 'Running `ghe-btop` failed with an error and cannot find a `babeld` container.'
        - MySQL could reload and cause downtime if you change auto failover settings.
        - After upgrading, a mismatch of internal and external timeout values created service unavailability.
        - Expected replication delays in MSSQL generated warnings.
        - 'Link to "[Configuring clustering](/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering)" on the Management Console was incorrect.'
        - When creating or editing a pre-receive hook, a race condition in the user interface meant that after selecting a repository, files within the repository were sometimes not populated in files dropdown.
        - When an IP address is added to a whitelist using "Create Whitelist Entry" button, it could still be shown as locked out.
        - References to the "Dependency graph" and "Dependabot alerts" features were not shown as disabled on some repositories.
        - Setting an announcement in the enterprise account settings could result in a 500 Internal Server Error.
        - HTTP POST requests to the `/hooks` endpoint could fail with a 401 response due to an incorrectly configured `hookID`.
        - The `build-server` process failed to clean up processes, leaving them in the `defunct` state.
        - '`spokesd` created excessive log entries, including the phrase "fixing placement skipped".'
        - While upgrading Actions the upgrade could fail if the instance could not make self-requests via its configured hostname.
        - Upgrading from 2.22.x to 3.1.0.rc1 could result in a database migration error relating to the `BackfillIntegrationApplicationCallbackUrlsTransition` data transition.

  known_issues:
    - Access to a repository through the administrative shell using `ghe-repo <owner>/<reponame>` will hang. As a workaround, use `ghe-repo <owner>/<reponame> -c "bash -i"` until a fix is available in the next version.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - Upgrading an instance that has previously ran a 2.13 release, but not a 2.14 release, results in a database migration error relating to the `AddRepositoryIdToCheckRuns` data transition.
    - |
      After upgrading from 3.0.x to 3.1.x, in some cases GitHub Actions can fail with an error: `An unexpected error occurred when executing this workflow.` To workaround this problem, connect to the administrative shell (ssh) and run:
      ```
      ghe-actions-console -s actions -c "Queue-ServiceJob -JobId 4DB1F4CF-19FD-40E0-A253-91288813DE8B"
      ```
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

The deprecated events `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories` have equivalent events which will be supported. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-the-installation-and-installation-repositories-events/).'
    - heading: Deprecation of Legacy GitHub Apps Endpoint
      notes:
        - Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.21.0 the legacy GitHub Apps endpoint for creating installation access tokens was deprecated and will be removed in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.2.0.

    - heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API
      notes:
        - 'GitHub no longer supports the OAuth application endpoints that contain `access_token` as a path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).'
    - heading: Deprecation of GitHub Actions short SHA support
      notes:
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} will remove support for referencing actions using the shortened version of a git commit SHA. This may cause some workflows in your repository to break. To fix these workflows, you will need to update the action reference to use the full commit SHA. For more information, see "[Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)."'
    - heading: Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support
      notes:
        - Beginning in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, we will begin discontinuing support for Xen Hypervisor. The complete deprecation is scheduled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, following the standard one year deprecation window.

  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.1.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/configuration/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'
