  security_fixes:
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - 'Custom pre-receive hooks could lead to an error like `error: object directory /data/user/repositories/0/nw/12/34/56/7890/network.git/objects does not exist; check .git/objects/info/alternates`.'
    - Unauthenticated HTTP proxy for the pages containers build was not supported for any users that use HTTP proxies.
    - A significant number of 503 errors were logged every time a user visited a repository''s `/settings` page if the dependency graph was not enabled.
    - Internal repositories were only returned when a user had affiliations with the repository through a team or through collaborator status, or queried with the `?type=internal` parameter.
    - Failed background jobs had unlimited retries which could cause large queue depths.
    - A significant number of 503 errors were being created if the scheduled job to sync vulnerabilities with GitHub.com attempted to run when dependency graph was not enabled and content analysis was enabled.
  changes:
    - The logs for `babeld` now include a `cmd` field for HTTP ref advertisement requests instead of only including it during the negotiation requests.
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - 当副本节点在高可用性配置下离线时，{% data variables.product.product_name %} 仍可能将 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 请求路由到离线节点，从而减少用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 可用性。
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
