    - '**HIGH:** A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.3 and has been assigned CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.'
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - SAML expiration date variable was not configurable.
    - Application services would fail their health checks during config apply before they could enter a healthy state.
    - '`ghe-cluster-config-node-init` would fail during cluster setup if HTTP proxy is enabled.'
    - Pre-receive hooks could encounter an error `Failed to resolve full path of the current executable` due to `/proc` not being mounted on the container.
    - Collectd would not resolve the forwarding destination hostname after the initial startup.
    - The job that purged stale deleted repositories could fail to make progress if some of those repositories were protected from deletion by legal holds.
    - Running `git nw-gc --pristine` would result in an error.
    - Background jobs were being queued to the `spam` queue which were not being processed.
    - The preferred merge method would be reset when retrying after a failed PR merge.
    - Git pushes could result in a 500 Internal Server Error during the user reconciliation process on instances using LDAP authentication mode.
  changes:
    - Improved the efficiency of config apply by skipping IP allow firewall rules that had not changed, which saved significant time on large clusters.
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 GitHub Enterprise Server 上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - 当副本节点在高可用性配置下离线时，{% data variables.product.product_name %} 仍可能将 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 请求路由到离线节点，从而减少用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 可用性。
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
