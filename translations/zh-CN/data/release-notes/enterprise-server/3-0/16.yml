  security_fixes:
    - '**HIGH:** A path traversal vulnerability was identified in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} that could be exploited when building a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site. User-controlled configuration options used by {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16, and 2.22.22. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22868. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/pages/pull/3360, https://github.com/github/pages/pull/3357 {% endcomment %}'
    - '**MEDIUM:** An improper access control vulnerability in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} allowed a workflow job to execute in a self-hosted runner group it should not have had access to. This affects customers using self-hosted runner groups for access control. A repository with access to one enterprise runner group could access all of the enterprise runner groups within the organization because of improper authentication checks during the request. This could cause code to be run unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability affected {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.7 and was fixed in 3.0.16 and 3.1.8 releases. It has been assigned CVE-2021-22869. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/enterprise2/pull/27003 {% endcomment %}'
  bugs:
    - 'Resque worker counts were displayed incorrectly during maintenance mode. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/enterprise2/pull/26898, https://github.com/github/enterprise2/pull/26883 {% endcomment %}'
    - 'Allocated memcached memory could be zero in clustering mode. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/enterprise2/pull/26927, https://github.com/github/enterprise2/pull/26832 {% endcomment %}'
    - 'Fixes {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} builds so they take into account the NO_PROXY setting of the appliance. This is relevant to appliances configured with an HTTP proxy only. (update 2021-09-30) {% comment %} https://github.com/github/pages/pull/3360 {% endcomment %}'
    - 'The GitHub Connect configuration of the source instance was always restored to new instances even when the `--config` option for `ghe-restore` was not used. This would lead to a conflict with the GitHub Connect connection and license synchronization if both the source and destination instances were online at the same time. The fix also requires updating backup-utils to 3.2.0 or higher. [updated: 2021-11-18]'
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - 当副本节点在高可用性配置下离线时，{% data variables.product.product_name %} 仍可能将 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 请求路由到离线节点，从而减少用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} 可用性。
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
