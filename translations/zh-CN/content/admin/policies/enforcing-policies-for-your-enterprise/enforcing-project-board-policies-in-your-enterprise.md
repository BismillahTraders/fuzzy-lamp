## About policies for project boards in your enterprise

You can enforce policies to control how members of your enterprise on {% data variables.product.product_name %} manage project boards. You can also allow organization owners to manage policies for project boards. For more information, see "[About project boards](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)."

## Enforcing a policy for organization-wide project boards

Across all organizations owned by your enterprise, you can enable or disable organization-wide project boards, or allow owners to administer the setting on the organization level.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.policies-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.projects-tab %}
4. Under "Organization projects", review the information about changing the setting. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.view-current-policy-config-orgs %}
5. Under "Organization projects", use the drop-down menu and choose a policy.
