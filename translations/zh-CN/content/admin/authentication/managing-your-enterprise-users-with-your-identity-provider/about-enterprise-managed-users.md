## About {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}

With {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you can control the user accounts of your enterprise members through your identity provider (IdP). You can simplify authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) and provision, update, and deprovision user accounts for your enterprise members. Users assigned to the {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_idp_application %} application in your IdP are provisioned as new user accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and added to your enterprise. You control usernames, profile data, team membership, and repository access from your IdP.

In your IdP, you can give each {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_user %} the role of user, enterprise owner, or billing manager. {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users_caps %} can own organizations within your enterprise and can add other {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} to the organizations and teams within. For more information, see "[Roles in an enterprise](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise)" and "[About organizations](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)."

You can also manage team membership within an organization in your enterprise directly through your IdP, allowing you to manage repository access using groups in your IdP. Organization membership can be managed manually or updated automatically as {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} are added to teams within the organization. For more information, see "[Managing team memberships with identity provider groups](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-your-enterprise-users-with-your-identity-provider/managing-team-memberships-with-identity-provider-groups)."

You can grant {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} access and the ability to contribute to repositories within your enterprise, but {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} cannot create public content or collaborate with other users, organizations, and enterprises on the rest of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. The {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} provisioned for your enterprise cannot be invited to organizations or repositories outside of the enterprise, nor can the {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} be invited to other enterprises. Outside collaborators are not supported by {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}.

The usernames of your enterprise's {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} and their profile information, such as display names and email addresses, are set by through your IdP and cannot be changed by the users themselves. For more information, see "[Usernames and profile information](#usernames-and-profile-information)."

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-forks %}

Enterprise owners can audit all of the {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %}' actions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

To use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you need a separate type of enterprise account with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} enabled. For more information about creating this account, see "[About enterprises with managed users](#about-enterprises-with-managed-users)."

## About enterprises with managed users

To use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you need a separate type of enterprise account with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} enabled. To try out {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} or to discuss options for migrating from your existing enterprise, please contact [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s Sales team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact).

Your contact on the GitHub Sales team will work with you to create your new {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_enterprise %}. You'll need to provide the email address for the user who will set up your enterprise and a short code that will be used as the suffix for your enterprise members' usernames. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-shortcode %} For more information, see "[Usernames and profile information](#usernames-and-profile-information)."

After we create your enterprise, you will receive an email from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} inviting you to choose a password for your enterprise's setup user, which will be the first owner in the enterprise. Use an incognito or private browsing window when setting the password. The setup user is only used to configure SAML single sign-on and SCIM provisioning integration for the enterprise. It will no longer have access to administer the enterprise account once SAML is successfully enabled.

The setup user's username is your enterprise's shortcode suffixed with `_admin`. After you log in to your setup user, you can get started by configuring SAML SSO for your enterprise. For more information, see "[Configuring SAML single sign-on for Enterprise Managed Users](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/managing-your-enterprise-users-with-your-identity-provider/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-enterprise-managed-users)."

## Authenticating as a {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_user %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users_caps %} must authenticate through their identity provider.

To authenticate, {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users %} must visit their IdP application portal or **https://github.com/enterprises/ENTERPRISE_NAME**, replacing **ENTERPRISE_NAME** with your enterprise's name.

## Usernames and profile information

When your {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_enterprise %} is created, you will choose a short code that will be used as the suffix for your enterprise member's usernames. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-shortcode %} The setup user who configures SAML SSO has a username in the format of **@<em>SHORT-CODE</em>_admin**.

When you provision a new user from your identity provider, the new {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_user %} will have a {% data variables.product.product_name %} username in the format of **@<em>IDP-USERNAME</em>_<em>SHORT-CODE</em>**. When using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), _IDP-USERNAME_ is formed by normalizing the characters preceding the `@` character in the UPN (User Principal Name) provided by Azure AD. When using Okta, _IDP-USERNAME_ is the normalized username attribute provided by Okta.

The username of the new account provisioned on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, including underscore and short code, must not exceed 39 characters.

The profile name and email address of a {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_user %} is also provided by the IdP. {% data variables.product.prodname_managed_users_caps %} cannot change their profile name or email address on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
