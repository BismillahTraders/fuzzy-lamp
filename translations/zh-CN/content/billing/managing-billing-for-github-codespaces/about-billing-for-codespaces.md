## How billing is handled for forked repositories

{% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} can only be used in organizations where a billable owner has been defined. To incur charges to the organization, the user must be a member or collaborator, otherwise they cannot create a codespace.

For example, a user in a private organization can fork a repository within that organization, and can subsequently use a codespace billed to the organization; this is because the organization is the owner of the parent repository, which can remove the user's access, the forked repository, and the codespace.

## How billing is handled when a repository is transferred

Usage is billed and reported on every hour. As such, you pay for any usage when a repository is within your organization. When a repository is transferred out of your organization, any codespaces in that repository are removed as part of the transfer process.

## What happens when users are removed

If a user is removed from an organization or repository, their codespaces are automatically deleted.
