Repository webhooks allow you to receive HTTP `POST` payloads whenever certain events happen in a repository. {% data reusables.webhooks.webhooks-rest-api-links %}

If you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, see our API documentation for [Organization Webhooks](/rest/reference/orgs#webhooks).

In addition to the REST API, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can also serve as a [PubSubHubbub](#pubsubhubbub) hub for repositories.

{% for operation in currentRestOperations %}
  {% if operation.subcategory == 'webhooks' %}{% include rest_operation %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

### Receiving Webhooks

In order for {% data variables.product.product_name %} to send webhook payloads, your server needs to be accessible from the Internet. We also highly suggest using SSL so that we can send encrypted payloads over HTTPS.

#### Webhook headers

{% data variables.product.product_name %} will send along several HTTP headers to differentiate between event types and payload identifiers. See [webhook headers](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#delivery-headers) for details.

### PubSubHubbub

GitHub can also serve as a [PubSubHubbub](https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/PubSubHubbub) hub for all repositories. PSHB is a simple publish/subscribe protocol that lets servers register to receive updates when a topic is updated. The updates are sent with an HTTP POST request to a callback URL.
Topic URLs for a GitHub repository's pushes are in this format:

`https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/{event}`

The event can be any available webhook event. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads)."

#### Response format

The default format is what [existing post-receive hooks should expect](/post-receive-hooks/): A JSON body sent as the `payload` parameter in a POST.  You can also specify to receive the raw JSON body with either an `Accept` header, or a `.json` extension.

    Accept: application/json
    https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/push.json

#### Callback URLs

Callback URLs can use the `http://` protocol.

    # Send updates to postbin.org
    http://postbin.org/123

#### Subscribing

The GitHub PubSubHubbub endpoint is: `{% data variables.product.api_url_code %}/hub`. A successful request with curl looks like:

``` shell
curl -u "user" -i \
  {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/hub \
  -F "hub.mode=subscribe" \
  -F "hub.topic=https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/push" \
  -F "hub.callback=http://postbin.org/123"
```

PubSubHubbub requests can be sent multiple times. If the hook already exists, it will be modified according to the request.

##### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
``hub.mode``|`string` | **Required**. Either `subscribe` or `unsubscribe`.
``hub.topic``|`string` |**Required**.  The URI of the GitHub repository to subscribe to.  The path must be in the format of `/{owner}/{repo}/events/{event}`.
``hub.callback``|`string` | The URI to receive the updates to the topic.
``hub.secret``|`string` | A shared secret key that generates a hash signature of the outgoing body content.  You can verify a push came from GitHub by comparing the raw request body with the contents of the {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 2.22 or ghec %}`X-Hub-Signature` or `X-Hub-Signature-256` headers{% elsif ghes < 3.0 %}`X-Hub-Signature` header{% elsif ghae %}`X-Hub-Signature-256` header{% endif %}. You can see [the PubSubHubbub documentation](https://pubsubhubbub.github.io/PubSubHubbub/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html#authednotify) for more details.
