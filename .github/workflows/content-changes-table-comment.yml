name: Content Changes Table Comment

# **What it does**: When a PR is opened in docs-internal or docs, it adds the staging preview and live article links in a Content Directory Changes table in a comment
# **Why we have it**: To help Docs Content team members and contributors automatically have their staging/live article links added to the table
# **Who does it impact**: docs-internal/docs maintainers and contributors

            **This comment is automatically generated and will be overwritten every time changes are committed to this branch.**

            The table contains an overview of files in the `content` directory that have been changed in this pull request. It's provided to make it easy to review your changes on the staging site. Please note that changes to the `data` directory will not show up in this table.

            ### Content directory changes
            _You may find it useful to copy this table into the pull request summary. There you can edit it to share links to important articles or changes and to give a high-level overview of how the changes in your pull request support the overall goals of the pull request._
