# **IMPORTANT:** Do not change the FREEZE environment variable set here!
# This workflow runs on a recurring basis. To temporarily disable it (e.g.,
# during a docs deployment freeze), add an Actions Secret to the repo settings
# called `FREEZE` with a value of `true`. To re-enable workflow, simply
# delete that Secret from the repo settings. The environment variable here
# will duplicate that Secret's value for later evaluation.

      # check-github-github-links.js returns 0 if no links are broken, and 1 if any links
      # are broken. When an Actions step's exit code is 1, the action run's job status
      # is failure and the run ends. The following steps create an issue for the
      # broken link report only if any links are broken, so `if: ${{ failure() }}`
      # ensures the steps run despite the previous step's failure of the job.
