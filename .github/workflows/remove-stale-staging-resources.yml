name: Remove stale staging resources

# **What it does**:
# This cleans up any rogue staging applications and environments that outlasted
# the closure of their corresponding pull requests.
# **Why we have it**:
# Staging applications and environments sometimes fail to be destroyed when
# their corresponding pull request is closed or merged.
# **Who does it impact**:
# Anyone with a closed, spammy, or deleted pull request in docs or docs-internal.
