name: Autoupdate branch

# **What it does**: The next pull request in the merge queue will get its
# branch updated with main. Only updating one branch ensures that pull requests
# in the queue are merged sequentially.
# **Why we have it**: So we don't have to watch pull requests and click
# update branch 1000x.
# **Who does it impact**: Our health.
#
# The merge queue consists of any pull requests with automerge enabled and
# are mergeable. There is a label that can be used to skip to the front of
# the queue (`skip-to-front-of-merge-queue`).
#
# This workflow is triggered when a `push` event occurs ON the `main` branch
#  (e.g. a PR was merged or a force-push was done).
#
# This workflow runs on all PRs created from source branches within the
# public and private docs repos but is won't work for PRs created from
# forked repos.
