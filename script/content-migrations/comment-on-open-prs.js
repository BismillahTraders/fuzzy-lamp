ðŸ‘‹ Hello! The docs-engineering team has just published an update that touches all content files in the repo. To reduce conflicts with \`main\`, we are sending out this message to help folks update their branches.

You'll need to do the following steps in Terminal. If you're not into that, ask in #docs-engineering and we'll help out!

1. Check out the branch associated with this PR. Don't update from \`main\` yet.
2. Run: \`script/content-migrations/remove-map-topics.js && script/content-migrations/update-tocs.js\`
3. Commit: \`git add . && git commit -m 'ran content migration scripts'\`
4. Update: \`git pull origin main\`

You may still have some conflicts to resolve. Feel free to ask us if you have questions or need help!

For a 5min demo of what the scripts do and why they're needed, check out [this screencast](https://www.loom.com/share/fa6501580b2a44d7a8a4357ee51e0c99).
