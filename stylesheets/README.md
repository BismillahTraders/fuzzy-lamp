# Styles

This website uses a Sass preprocessor, and gets most of its styles from GitHub's
[Primer](https://primer.style) design system.

All styles come from imports in our Next.js compnents (pages, components).

In general, we use Primer's [utility classes](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/)
as much as we can, and avoid writing custom styles whenever possible.

See [styleguide.github.com/primer](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/) for reference.
