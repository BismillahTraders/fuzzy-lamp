  security_fixes:
    - 'It was possible for cleartext passwords to end up in certain log files.'
    - 'Several known weak SSH public keys have been added to the deny list and can no longer be registered. In addition, versions of GitKraken known to generate weak SSH keys (7.6.x, 7.7.x and 8.0.0) have been blocked from registering new public keys.'
    - 'Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.'
  bugs:
    - 'Restore might fail for enterprise server in clustering mode if orchestrator isnt healthily.'
    - 'Several parts of the application were unusable for users who are owners of many organizations.'
    - 'Fixed a link to https://docs.github.com.'
  changes:
    - 'Browsing and job performance optimizations for repositories with many refs.'
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
