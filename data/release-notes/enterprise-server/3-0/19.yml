  security_fixes:
    - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} builds on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} that could allow an attacker to read system files. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needed permission to create and build a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} prior to 3.3, and was fixed in versions 3.0.19, 3.1.11, and 3.2.3. This vulnerability was reported through the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22870.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Some Git operations failed after upgrading a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.x cluster because of the HAProxy configuration.
    - Unicorn worker counts might have been set incorrectly in clustering mode.
    - Resqued worker counts might have been set incorrectly in clustering mode.
    - If Ubuntu's Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) status was inactive, a client could not clearly see it in the logs.
    - Some pages and Git-related background jobs might not run in cluster mode with certain cluster configurations.
    - The enterprise audit log page would not display audit events for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}.
    - 'Users were not warned about potentially dangerous bidirectional unicode characters when viewing files. For more information, see "[Warning about bidirectional Unicode text](https://github.co/hiddenchars)" in {% data variables.product.prodname_blog %}.'
    - Hookshot Go sent distribution type metrics that Collectd could not handle, which caused a ballooning of parsing errors.
    - Public repositories displayed unexpected results from {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} with a type of `Unknown Token`.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
