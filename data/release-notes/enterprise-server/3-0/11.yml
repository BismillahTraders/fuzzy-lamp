  security_fixes:
    - '**HIGH:** A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.3 and has been assigned CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.'
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - SAML expiration date variable was not configurable.
    - Application services would fail their health checks during config apply before they could enter a healthy state.
    - '`ghe-cluster-config-node-init` would fail during cluster setup if HTTP proxy is enabled.'
    - Pre-receive hooks could encounter an error `Failed to resolve full path of the current executable` due to `/proc` not being mounted on the container.
    - Collectd would not resolve the forwarding destination hostname after the initial startup.
    - The job that purged stale deleted repositories could fail to make progress if some of those repositories were protected from deletion by legal holds.
    - Running `git nw-gc --pristine` would result in an error.
    - Background jobs were being queued to the `spam` queue which were not being processed.
    - The preferred merge method would be reset when retrying after a failed PR merge.
    - Git pushes could result in a 500 Internal Server Error during the user reconciliation process on instances using LDAP authentication mode.
  changes:
    - Improved the efficiency of config apply by skipping IP allow firewall rules that had not changed, which saved significant time on large clusters.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
