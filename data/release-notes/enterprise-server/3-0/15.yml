  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Attempting to tear down a newly-added replica node by specifying its UUID with `ghe-repl-teardown` would fail without reporting an error if replication was not started.
    - GitHub Pages builds were being passed through an external proxy if there was one configured.
    - Custom pre-receive hooks that created sub-processes would lack a `PATH` variable in their environment, resulting in "No such file or directory" errors.
    - MySQL could failover during an upgrade if `mysql-auto-failover` was enabled.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
