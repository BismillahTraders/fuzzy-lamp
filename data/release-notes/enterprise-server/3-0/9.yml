  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - The upgrade process could fail while upgrading Actions if the instance could not make self-requests using its configured hostname.
    - SVN 1.7 and older clients showed an error when using the `svn co` and `svn export` commands.
    - Accessing a repository through the administrative shell using `ghe-repo <owner>/<reponame>` would hang.
    - After upgrading, users experienced reduced availability during heavy usage, because services restarted too frequently. This would occur due to timeout mismatches between the nomad configuration and that of the internal services.
    - In some instances, running `ghe-repl-status` after setting up GitHub Actions would produce an error and `ghe-actions-teardown` would fail.
    - '`ghe-dbconsole` would return errors under some circumstances.'
    - Import failures of organizations or repositories from non-GitHub sources could produce an `undefined method '[]' for nil:NilClass` error.
    - GitHub profile names might have changed unintentionally when using SAML authentication, if the GitHub profile name did not match the value of the attribute mapped to the `Full name` field in the Management Console.
  changes:
    - The `firstPatchedVersion` field is now available on `SecurityVulnerability` objects in the GraphQL API.
    - Users of the GraphQL API can query the public field `closingIssuesReferences` on the `PullRequest` object. This field retrieves issues that will be automatically closed when the related pull request is merged. This approach will also allow this data to be migrated in future, as part of a higher fidelity migration process.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
