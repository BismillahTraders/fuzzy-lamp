Setting a webhook secret allows you to ensure that `POST` requests sent to the payload URL are from {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you set a secret, you'll receive the {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %}`X-Hub-Signature` and `X-Hub-Signature-256` headers{% elsif ghae %}`X-Hub-Signature-256` header{% endif %} in the webhook `POST` request. For more information on how to use a secret with a signature header to secure your webhook payloads, see "[Securing your webhooks](/webhooks/securing/)."
