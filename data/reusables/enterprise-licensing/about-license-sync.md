You can allocate the user count for your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} license to members of both {% data variables.product.product_location_enterprise %} and an enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. When you add a user to either environment, the user will consume one license. If a user has accounts in both environments, to consume only one license, the user's primary email address on {% data variables.product.product_location_enterprise %} must be the same as the user's verified email address on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. You can sync license count and usage between the environments.
