If your site is an independent project, you can create a new repository to store your site's source code. If your site is associated with an existing project, you can add the source code to that project's repository, in a `/docs` folder on the default branch or on a different branch. For example, if you're creating a site to publish documentation for a project that's already on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you may want to store the source code for the site in the same repository as the project.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}If the account that owns the repository uses {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for organizations, the repository must be public.{% endif %}

If you want to create a site in an existing repository, skip to the "[Creating your site](#creating-your-site)" section.
