If you select **Enable IP allow list configuration for installed GitHub Apps** in your allow list settings, then IP addresses from installed {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} are added to your allow list. This happens irrespective of whether your allow list is currently enabled. If you install a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} and then the creator of that application changes the addresses in its allow list, your allow list is automatically updated with those changes.

You can identify the IP addresses that have been automatically added from {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} by reviewing the description field. The description for these IP addresses is: "Managed by the NAME GitHub App." Unlike addresses you add manually, you cannot edit, delete, or disable IP addresses that are automatically added from {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}.
