Once you've made changes to your codespace, either new code or configuration changes, you'll want to commit your changes. Committing changes to your repository ensures that anyone else who creates a codespace from this repository has the same configuration. This also means that any customization you do, such as adding {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} extensions, will appear for all users.

For information, see "[Using source control in your codespace](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#committing-your-changes)."
