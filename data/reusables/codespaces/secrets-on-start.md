Once you have created a secret, it will be available when you create a new codespace or restart the codespace. To use a secret that you've just created in a current codespace, you will need to stop the codespace and resume it. For information about stopping the codespace, see "[Using the Command Palette in {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}](/codespaces/codespaces-reference/using-the-command-palette-in-codespaces#suspending-or-stopping-a-codespace)."
