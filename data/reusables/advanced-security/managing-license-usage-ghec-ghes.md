When you enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} for repositories, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} displays an overview of changes to the use of your license. If you disable access to {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, any seats used by "unique" committers are freed up.

If you are over your license limit, {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} continues to work on all repositories where it is already enabled. However, in organizations where {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is enabled for new repositories, repositories will be created with the feature disabled. In addition, the option to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for existing repositories will not be available.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If you change the visibility of a public repository to private then {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} will be disabled for that repository.{% endif %}

As soon as you free up some seats, by disabling {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for some repositories or by increasing your license size, the options for enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} will work again as normal.
