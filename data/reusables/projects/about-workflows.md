Projects (beta) includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the **Status** of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to **Todo** when an item is added to your project or set the status to **Done** when an issue is closed.

When your project initializes, two workflows are enabled by default: When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to **Done**, and when pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to **Done**.
