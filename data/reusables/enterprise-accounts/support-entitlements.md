To open, view, and comment on support tickets associated with an enterprise account, you must have support entitlements for the account. Enterprise owners and billing managers automatically have a support entitlement, and enterprise owners can add support entitlements to enterprise members. For more information, see "[Managing support entitlements for your enterprise](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-support-entitlements-for-your-enterprise)."
