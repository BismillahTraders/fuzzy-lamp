If you want to allow members to receive email notifications at a domain you don't own, you can approve the domain, then allow {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to send email notifications to addresses within the domain. For example, you can allow a contractor who doesn't have an email address within your own domain to receive email notifications at a domain you feel comfortable with.
