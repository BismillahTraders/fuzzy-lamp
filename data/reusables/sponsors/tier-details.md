You can create up to 10 one-time sponsorship tiers and 10 monthly tiers for sponsors to choose from. Each tier has its own one-time or monthly payment amount in US dollars, and you can choose to enable tiers for custom amounts. In addition, you can choose to enable tiers for custom amounts (monthly and one-time).

You can customize the rewards for each tier. For example, rewards for a tier could include:
- Early access to new versions 
- Logo or name in README
- Access to a private repository
- Weekly newsletter updates
- Other rewards your sponsors would enjoy âœ¨ 

You can include a welcome message with information about accessing or receiving rewards, which will be visible after payment and in the welcome email.

Once you have published a tier, you cannot edit the price of that tier. Instead, you must retire the tier and create a new tier. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.
