**Notes:** 
- SARIF upload supports a maximum of {% ifversion ghae or fpt or ghes > 3.0 or ghec %}5000{% else %}1000{% endif %} results per upload. Any results over this limit are ignored. If a tool generates too many results, you should update the configuration to focus on results for the most important rules or queries.

 - For each upload, SARIF upload supports a maximum size of 10 MB for the `gzip`-compressed SARIF file. Any uploads over this limit will be rejected. If your SARIF file is too large because it contains too many results, you should update the configuration to focus on results for the most important rules or queries.
