{% note %}

**Note**: the option to enable auto-merge is shown only on pull requests that cannot be merged immediately. For example, when a branch protection rule enforces "Require pull request reviews before merging" or "Require status checks to pass before merging" and these conditions are not yet met. For more information, see "[Managing a branch protection rule](/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
